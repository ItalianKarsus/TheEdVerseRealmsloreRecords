Thultanthar crashed atop Myth Drannor in 1487 DR, shattering Myth Drannor’s mythal into a wild state. It has since (by about late spring of 1489 DR) settled down somewhat (largely due to the Weave-repairing efforts of Mystra’s

Chosen), but remains unpredictable (i.e. a DM should feel free to have it exhibit wild magic effects, allow some magics on some occasions but not on others, and so on). At night, deep blue glows flicker at random over the

+_> 7) while outside in winter, in the mythal area). Note that some of these properties were ‘turned off’ by powerful elf defenders of the city, and Chosen, during their defense of Myth Drannor just before the fall of Thultanthor.

Sat Sep 29 18:55:28 (Faithless, Realmslore, Waukeen, the Realms)

?_> [@] [@] questions from my friend.
I'm a chinese fan of the Realms. As is known to all, the official idea of PRChina is atheism. Thus, many, if not all, of us chinese fans don't really understand the difference between "believe", "worship" and "faith". (1 
?_> [@] [@] If the "atheist" will be judged as the Faithless, so as an "atheist" I do worry about my (character's) soul.
My first question is, what's "the difference between faith and belief"?
And there are a series of scenarios below, will this be judged as "worship" a god? (2 
?_> [@] [@] 1) Someone joined a celebration of a holiday of a god he doesn't care.
Someone don't like Tempus but being a great general, or someone never praise Mystra but being a powerful spellcaster.
Someone donate a few coins to a temple of Tyr, but he don't like Tyr's teaching (3 
?_> [@] [@] 4) Someone respect the teaching of a god, but will not entrust his life and soul to the god.
Sorry for my poor English, and many thanks to those answering my question. (4 
+_> 1)
Hi!
In the Realms, all sane sentient beings “believe” in the gods (= know they exist and affect the world), because they have seen avatars or divine servitor beings (e.g. aasimars, celestials) and/or see signs and spells from
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) the gods and/or been shown dramatic evidence of past manifestations of divine power (e.g. a god blasting apart a mountain with magic “from the sky”) and/or seen priests work real, lasting magic through prayer to their deities. 
+_> 3)
So everyone in the Realms “believes” (they KNOW the gods are real). “Faith” has two real-world meanings: the collective one of “everyone who believes in this god or this pantheon or this creed” (clergy and lay worshippers) 
+_> 4) and “believing in a deity without hard proof” and therefore taking the existence of the deity “on faith.” In the Realms, the first meaning is widely used and understood, the second is not (why? See above).
Worship” means 
+_> 5) doing as the god wants you to (or the god’s clergy tell you to), working to advance the aims of the god (which might even mean fighting on behalf of the god), and making offerings to the church (coins or items), and taking 
+_> 6) part in rituals and prayers.
In the Realms, everyone ‘believes in’ ALL of the gods, and although a lot of humans (priests, paladins, and lay worshippers) ‘specialize’ in one god (worshipping that one deity more than others) 
+_> 7) most sentient beings do at least a little worshipping of many deities: a merchant wanting business success would pray and give offerings to Waukeen, and if that merchant is shipping goods aboard on a ship, would also pray 
+_> 8) and give offerings to Umberlee to NOT sink the ship, and if that same merchant was trying to use new technology to make their goods faster or better or both, he or she would also pray and give offerings to Gond, and so on. 
+_> 9)
So you can see that there’s a lot of ‘lip-service’ worship of deities by people who otherwise don’t care overmuch about that god or their faith. The gods want obedience AND worship because they gain power the more they are 
+_> 10) worshipped and have influence in the mortal world, so YES, they would count someone participating in celebration of one of their holy days as worship.
In the Realms, deities have portfolios, and Tempus is the god of war and 
+_> 11) warcraft, just as Mystra is the goddess of (arcane) magic. A mortal can be a great general or a powerful spellcaster without actively worshipping Tempus or Mystra, respectively. The deity will manipulate that mortal, and 
+_> 12) exploit that mortal’s achievements, to increase their divine influence. So, yes, they would still count the deeds of that mortal as worship—but they would also constantly send clergy AND dream-visions to that mortal to try 
+_> 13) to entice the mortal to “embrace” (openly worship) them.
Mortals aren’t required to like the creed or world-view of a deity (though the deity would prefer that they love the deity and the deity’s ways) so much as the deity 
+_> 14) wants them to obey (behave in certain ways), and donating coins to a temple is definitely worship.
And there are many mortals who respect the clergy, teachings, and deeds of a particular god, but don’t entrust their lives 
+_> 15) to the god, or formally dedicate their souls to that god or any god. Deities always want souls and lives dedicated to them if possible, but they’ll unhesitatingly take respect and the above-mentioned lip-service worship 
+_> 16) (including donating a few coins from time to time) as worship, even from a mortal who refuses to dedicate themselves. They will also tirelessly try to persuade that mortal to accept them more fully.
Hope this is of help! 
+_> 17)
I should add that the “dream visions” sent by gods to sleeping mortals often include the deity appearing to the mortal directly in their dreams, speaking to them (advice, commands, cryptic hints), and that all deities employ 
+_> 18) manifestations” (glows or visible-to-all temporary images moving in the air, smells, and visitations by birds or creatures associated with the deity, etc.) of their favour or disfavour or interest, that awake people can 
+_> 19) see. These usually appear above altars during prayers, or at a spot where someone has just made or is making a sacrifice to the god (including sacrificing their mortal lives), but can also appear elsewhere, to convince or 
+_> 20) reassure non-believers or mortals who doubt what the right thing to do is.

?_> [@] Hi Ed, Hope your recovery is going well. Wondering what lore you can give on the House of Baerlaer of Arabel, and the layout of their home (#60 on the Arabel map in Cormyr). As always many thanks. ~GG 
+_> 1)
Hi, Gareth! See this thread at the Candlekeep forums: “Forgotten Realms Journals/Running the Realms/ THE UNRELIABLE FIVE: THEIR EYES ON THE REALMS” by Jeremy Grenemyer. From it we learn that the keyed feature #60 on the Arabel
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) map is a “small but grand castle” built of stone, that’s “now the seat of power for the Guild of Binders, Printers and Copyists in Arabel
The House of Baerlear isn’t a noble family, but a successful merchant family, based in 
+_> 3)
Arabel for centuries. At the time of Jeremy’s adventure, the patriarch of the family (Nelezmur “the Book Tyrant” Baerlear) is the Guildmaster of the Binders, Printers, and Copyists.
Much of the guild’s daily coin (and 
+_> 4) therefore, the income of the Baerlears) comes from printing handbills (one-page advertising handouts) and business forms (from laundry chits to detailed orders used by various craftworkers and shopkeepers). But the Baerlears 
+_> 5) have been successful merchants for decades, in part because they’ve diversified: they are landlords (and property buyers and sellers) in Arabel; they buy large stretches of wild forest and woodlots in northeastern Arabel from 
+_> 6) which to harvest pulp for papermaking, and timber that they sell to builders in southern Cormyr and Sembia (whoever will pay most); and they invest in the side-businesses of local gnome and dwarf families who make and 
+_> 7) maintain the printing presses they (and the guild they’re part of) use.
The House of Baerlear itself is a stout fieldstone castle of four towers linked by thick walls to enclose a courtyard. The only difference between the 
+_> 8)
House and an old wilderland keep is that it has large (tall, narrow) windows, a few with iron-bar windowboxes but not balconies, rather than just arrowslits. The towers end in conical roofs, built over the crenelated flat-top 
+_> 9) battlements sixty years ago, and the castle has a more-than-coach-wide arched main gate, currently filled by stout ironbar latticework double doors chained and barred together when closed (the metal-plated wooden doors with 
+_> 10) inner props were replaced more than a century ago).
The Baerlears own a family (closed) coach (think stagecoach), a “fast litter” (open carriage; think phaeton), and two goods wagons, which are parked in the interior 
+_> 11) courtyard when not in use. The rest of the courtyard is filled with hay and a grass plot for the horses (the ground floor of the “back wall” (north wall) of the castle, facing the gate, is the stables), and a kitchen garden 
+_> 12) sited to catch the most sun.
The “front wall” (south wall) of the castle west of the gate houses the business part of the castle: the servants dwell there, and the family business offices, stockrooms, and “working rooms 
+_> 13) (workshops, etc.) are located there. The front wall east of the gate houses a three-floor entry hall reached via doors on the north/inner side of the east gate tower; one passes through a circular foyer (with cloakrooms 
+_> 14) garderobes, doorguards’ ready room, and mudroom) located on the ground floor of the tower, to reach the grand hall (with crimson tapestries and carpets, and much rich, dark woodwork) that fills that part of the eastern 
+_> 15) front/south wall adjoining the east gate tower. This hall is dominated by balconies on the upper floors looking down into the hall, and a grand stair ascending from the ground floor to the floor above, and then a second 
+_> 16) flight ascending to the third. House servants have their ready rooms (and “ready pantries” and sewing rooms) on the uppermost floor, guest apartments are located on the middle floor, with the family’s suites of personal

+_> 18) and middle floors of the east wall.
The House of Baerlear is built over its own deep well of drinkable water, which occupies the cellar of the northeast tower.
In the past, several Baerlear patriarchs and matriarchs made 
+_> 19) extra coin by renting out apartments in the western floors of the north wall to “suitable” tenants, often Crown officials and Arabel-stationed (sometimes as family business representatives, and sometimes more like 
+_> 20) remittance men,” to be away from parents who detested them or despaired of them) sons and daughters of wealthy “wannabe-noble” families of Suzail and Marsember. This practise ebbs and flows with the personal preferences of 
+_> 21) heads of the Baerlears; some shudder at the thought of “strangers staying under our roof as anything more than passing guests,” while others welcome the income (which at times has more than covered all running costs of the

Hope these details are of help.

I wish the wise Elminster could give us a short vocabulary of arcane words that practitioners of the Art often say as V components for casting spells. Like: Fire, time, Air, thunder, cloud, illusory, vines, water, protecion, harm, move and such. 
+_> 1)
In the Realms, incantations for the same spell vary from caster to caster. Most casters today didn’t create most of the spells they use; they learned them from a mentor/tutor, from studying a spellbook, or by reading or
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) copying off a scroll, so they’re using the wording a predecessor devised (or got from an even earlier source). So the incantations may rhyme, or not. They may employ words from a variety of languages, or stick to one tongue. 
+_> 3)
What the incantation is trying to do is to help THAT CASTER properly visualize the spell effect and identify the target/area of effect/direction (and in some cases, intensity and duration, too), as the spell’s 
+_> 4) material component (if any) is called upon as a focus and/or consumed, and the somatic component (gestures) work to trigger/unleash the magic in proper timing with the incantation or word, to tap the power of the Weave in 
+_> 5) a specific manner to achieve a particular magical effect. So incantations can vary. There ARE some “go to” arcane words, which sound vaguely to our real-world ears like Latin or Greek, but aren’t, that function as reliable

Weave-tap doorways” for all arcane casters because they’ve been used so often, over so many years, that they’ve established ‘pathways’ (“trained the Weave,” if you will) to call up certain sorts of magical effects. 
+_> 7)
If you’re still bearing with me after all of this arcane-sage-blather, I WILL get around (probably in more than a year from now, in an ENWorld column) to presenting some of those go-to arcane words I use. A few brief 
+_> 8) snatches of incantations have appeared in some of my Realms fiction, over the years, but for much of the time the Realms has been published, there was a specific editorial policy (I’m guessing to avoid real-world problems)

Tue Oct 02 01:29:46 (Bhaal, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] Hi Ed! I have a question for you regarding death worship in the Realms. How would you characterise the difference in behaviour and practice between Myrkulytes, Cyricists, and Bhaalites, when their respective deities held dominion over death / the dead? And 
?_> [@] .. would you have found temples to these "evil" deities in goodly governed cities and realms, when their purview is so inescapable for the vast majority? If so, how does a Myrkulyte / Cyricist / Bhaalite function in such a hostile (to them) land? 
?_> Any thoughts on this, [@] ? 
+_> 1)
This one got lost in all of the prep for my surgery. Sorry!
Here we go
BHAALISTS tend to operate “undercover,” having a daytime identity (often a shopkeeper or delivery carter in a large city), with a private cellar (or
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) sometimes attic or city catacombs) shrine where they pray to the god before and after a murder expedition. (So, no public temples! A few remote monasteries, yes, but temples, no.)
Few neighbours or city authorities will know 
+_> 3) a priest of the Lord of Murder is a cleric of Bhaal. The Bhaalist/Bhaalyn observes unfolding life in the city and picks targets to be murdered, often troublemakers, individuals rising in power or wealth, or even clergy of 
+_> 4) rival deities.
Then, in the darkest dead of night, at least once a tenday, properly clad as a Bhaalist, they murder their target, and “take home” some token or trophy (from a finger or heart of their victim, to personal 
+_> 5) jewelry), plus wealth from the victim if available. The token or trophy is offered to Bhaal on a simple altar anointed with the Bhaalist’s own blood, with prayers, and the wealth used by the Bhaalist to fund their ongoing 
+_> 6) life and continue their holy work.
MYRKULYTES keep to themselves, speaking to few (remember the silent Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come/Ghost of Christmas Future in A CHRISTMAS CAROL?) but appearing hooded and cowled in public 
+_> 7) to spread fear of the Lord of Bones. Most folk of Faerûn believe that touching a priest of the Lord of Bones will bring death, and Myrkulytes hunt down and slay anyone who throws stones or casts other missiles at them, to 
+_> 8) enhance their personal protection; as a result, they’re silently shunned in most places, and can walk untouched, not even spoken to (people melt away from their path, turn their backs, and so on). They dwell in small 
+_> 9) fortified stone (with tile roofs; the idea is to make the structures difficult to burn by a mob or someone hurling the equivalent of Molotov cocktails) temples known as mausoleums. Myrkulytes grow their own food, including 
+_> 10) mushrooms in cellars, and are supplied with food, tools and other goods, consecrated ‘black wine,’ and information by traveling Myrkulytes who constantly travel from mausoleum to mausoleum (from remote valley, ravine, or 
+_> 11) cavern bases).
CYRICISTS are hated across the Realms, because they foment strife and do many murders to spread fear of Cyric. They also work against friendships, love matches, and familial ties, and spread chaos, making them 
+_> 12) detested by most. Who would rise up and slay them if they dared.
Most urban Cyricist temples are former Myrkulyte mausoleums, and so hard-to-burn stone fortresses, from which Cyricists usually emerge by night, with spells at 
+_> 13) the ready to defeat and chase away mobs. They then go about murdering, spreading (often false) gossip that will set folk against each other, and bribing or even sponsoring (the church seizes as much as it can from its 
+_> 14) murder victims, and so is never short of funds) dissatisfied individuals to increase active intrigue (often emboldening opponents of local rulers, rebellious nobles, and strife within royalty, nobility, or wealthy families). 
+_> 15)
Cyricists don’t want to start wars (and so benefit Tempus), they want to sew seething mistrust. They are dangerous to any local society because their behaviour is often boldly mad or erratic, in reverence to the madness 
+_> 16) of the Dark Sun himself. Part of their intrigue is to build very good (well paid) intelligence networks, so they often knew when a king or local ruler was fed up and intending to exterminate them—and they’d simply flee 
+_> 17) their temples and go elsewhere for some months, only to sidle back into a community during local festivities or crises, to murder and intrigue anew.
Hope these contrasted descriptions are of help!

Wed Dec 12 00:14:04 (Masked Lord, Open Lord, Realmslore, Waterdeep)

?_> To all my D&D players and Dungeon Masters, what do you think: 
Is entering someone's house illegal? I can't find the concept of Home Invasion in the Code Legal of Waterdeep, but in my opinion it is illegal. What do you think? If it is, what crime would it be?
Thanks! dnd #ttrpg [:] 
+_> 1)
The Code Legal is a rather simple document, that over the centuries has been extensively bolstered by case law (decisions of magisters or the Lords that add to it by precedent, without formally adding new laws).
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
In this manner, home invasions have come to be handled in this way: if no forcible entry is made (i.e. someone slips through an unsecured door or window), nothing is taken or damaged, and no one is physically disturbed 
+_> 3) (i.e. no one gets slapped awake or intimidated, no chamberpots or ewers of wash-water emptied over any sleepers, etc.), a charge of disturbing the peace is made, and the sentence of that crime is applied (“edict” includes 
+_> 4) public posting of offender[s] identity/identities, and the Watch puts them on local patrol ‘watch lists,’ which can include the Watch wakening offenders in the wee hours to check on what they’re up to. Note: the Watch and 
+_> 5)
Guard, or the Open Lord and Palace officials (inspectors, tax collectors, etc.) CANNOT be charged over a home invasion if on official duty; i.e. they can enter premises and it’s not a crime.
If, however, forcible entry is 
+_> 6) made, or property within the domicile is damaged by an intruder, then to the charge of disturbing the peace is added a charge of damaging property or livestock (yes, under the Code Legal, charges can ‘stack;’ whether they 
+_> 7) will or not in any particular case is up to the Lords, because if the Watch ‘hurls the Code’ at an undercover Lords’ agent or someone in favour, the Lords will reduce or eliminate charges ere a magister does any sentencing— 
+_> 8) whereas if it’s someone in disfavour, an accused will face all charges made). On a guilty finding, the usual sentence for damaging property or livestock applies.
If property is stolen, a charge of burglary is added, and the 
+_> 9) usual sentence applies. If persons in the residence are assaulted, a charge of assaulting a citizen is added for each person (if they are citizens of Waterdeep; outlanders are afforded no protection under the Code Legal, but 
+_> 10) note that if you rent or own real estate property in the city, belong to a city guild, or have paid any recorded levy or tax, you’re a “citizen”). If persons residing on the invaded premises are awakened or threatened and 
+_> 11) feel fear,” this same charge is leveled for each person affected, but the sentence/punishment is nominal (and often used by magisters to cobble together a sentence that “fits the crime,” so drunks or ‘madwits’ or 
+_> 12) wandering-witted’ (dementia) offenders may get a gentle slap on the wrist, but gangs who intimidate, of families building into a feud, get the Code hurled at them). If anyone can be proven to have hired home invaders, they can 
+_> 13) face the same charges (proof can be hard to get, though, in the case of wily nobles or guildmasters or wealthy ‘wannabe nobles.’ However, the Xanathar, the Unseen, rival nobles, and even some unscrupulous Masked Lords have 
+_> 14) been known to fabricate proof in the past, so everything gets closely looked at, and mere verbal claims will only result in an accused getting put on a Watch ‘watch list’ and the attention of undercover agents of the Lords). 
+_> 15)
Hope all of this is of some help!

The third Talassan to be the Zulkir of Evocation was Shalarkra Rhandalaer (Zulkir of Evocation 1166 DR – 1182 DR). She was a short, slender, dark-haired, vivacious woman with piercing dark brown eyes set under severe black

So endeth my answer to Question 1. Answers to Qs 2 and 3 are coming, perhaps late tonight, or perhaps tomorrow. We’ll see. :}

?_> "The smell of rotting flesh floods your senses. The humid air is prolonging its decay. Glimmering with the central mass of ribs and hanging flesh is what appears to be coins. A broken lance juts out from one side." [:] 
?_> "As you close the distance, pushing the boundries of your senses is the remains of a steed. Its leathers and harness still strapped loosely among the bones. The shell of a valiant knight lay crushed under beadt and mount. The last battle and resting place for all 
?_> "The jungles are lush, ruins in the distance. You and your party push forward. The skull of a dragon peers back from dense foilage at you. No life fills the eyeless sockets of this monstrous beast. The tales were true. This is the resting place. The triumverate falls 
?_> "Three massive archways. The tracks of beast, mount, and rider making way from their fallen forms into the ruins. There is still magic enough here
The parchment! The parchment!"
You hastely hand over the burnt and torn parchment to Griggand The Wise, scribe and your employer. 
?_> "Allbeit, This is the place. You have done it. We are all saved. We can end this curse upon those granted second lives. Our coffers will flow with coins. What say you? Are you up for more coin?"
As you and you company make glances about, you roll back the parchment to its case. 
?_> "About that," Sophia grins "How much coins are we talking here?"
Why enough to last lefetimes my dear, you could retire from this life, settle down, have we ones
Ya, about that" as dagger plants to hilt into the once wise wizard "I kinda like my life just the way it is 
?_> Griggand falls solidly among the wet fronds. You swallow just the same. You assumed the wizard had plans of his own. You don't question your parties leader. A powerful woman, barbarian, rogue, you have yet to decide. All you know is she has taken a fancy to you. 
?_> Not in that roll in the hay kind of fancy. More of a I like what you can do for me kind of fancy. Nevertheless, she pays you, and pays you well. She listens to you. At least you think she does.
You didn't need to kill him you know," You stammer out loud. 
?_> She looks down at the humped over robes and the lifeless form. "I know, I know. I feel bad about that, I do. We will bury him. But trust me when I say this, he would have buried us the first gaze his eyes laid on that prize below
You cannot deny her honesty. 
?_> He very well could have. The thing is purely magical. The way the gears rotate and turn. The way the lights shine from each circulating orb, rotating around that strange shape in the center. You have seen this before. So has she. Your company knows full well what it means. 
?_> As you step lightly into the chambers and retrace your steps they all follow suit. When you reach the central chamber, the sight nearly drops you all. A multiverse of cosmos rotating around a massive skeletal form the size of a large city. 
?_> Once dormant, now in full motion before your very eyes.
It worked, you little bastard, it worked"
I told you it would work"
Yes you did, you did" she moves uncomfortable close "And you will be rewarded for that" she playfully taps your nose. 
?_> "Alright gents you know the drill. That wizards blood won't last for long. Use your axes and swords and free up the rest of these. We need it all in motion for this to work
There is a magesty about her. In the glint of light you catch her eyes glance back at you. 
?_> She winks, but that is not a humans eye that looks back at you. Your necklace given to you by the Concordant Order of IO in secret goes taunt, you feel your muscles tighten. That is no woman. The vibrations of the symbol hanging around your neck paralyze you. 
?_> She glances back. Her breath gasps at the dense air, sweat trickeling down your companions necks, but not hers. Freeing up the ladt of the binding struts sends to more multiverse into motion and time begins to slow. You stare back at the center of this cosmological marvel. 
?_> Suddenly all is stopped. You feel a weight lifted from you. Your eyes gaze at the center light, at the massive form rising upwards.
Greetings, I am IO, you know I and I know you young one
You glance towards your companions, towards her motionless. 
?_> "Not to worry young one, she is harmless to you now. I cannot be totally consumed with hate towards her, she brought you to me. I will release her from her quest, pardon her bloodline for this. A wise decision for her. But enough about her. Let's talk about you young one 
?_> "I have a task for you. War is always coming. It never ceases. Even the struggle of life and death would always remain. As it shall always be. Eternity is not for us all. It can be yours if you are willing, but you can never seek it young one, it will find you 
?_> "For those without have only deeds to live on, and its those deeds I treasure. Worlds who never knew heroes, never asked for heroes, need them even more now. Darkness threatens light, shadows trickle in. There are ways to upset the balance. Mythals long forgotten 
?_> "I must task you to do what I cannot. I am everywhere and everything now, since time immemorial, until the return of the Obyriths I remain. A day it is to be humbled such am I the 9fold dragon to ask a single soul to perform a single act upon the cosmos." laughter fills the hall. 
?_> "Power is not the only thing that builds worlds young one. A single soul can change lives. Countless realms by a single deed. Each effecting the other. The great wheel of the cosmos. You among others must do this for me. Remind the multiverse and cosmos beyond 
?_> "Remind them what true heroes are made of, and what they can do. I give you my blessing young one, you may call on me in a time of great need. I am the stone, the churning stream, the old maiden making bread, the child at play, the mouse underfoot. Speak my name, I will answer 
?_> "Travel to the great feasting halls of the north. There is a man there, a towering man, a giant, within him rests the greatest of bests. Believe me when I tell you this, He will fall the mightest of foes. He knows the path and task before you 
?_> "To his side is a fey maiden. Do not gaze upon her beauty for long, it will surely kill you. She carries with her the regelia I am gifting you. Every hero needs a quest, and adventure to motivate them, to build their legend. I do enjoy a good tale, I have written many myself 
?_> In a flash he is gone. The presence of time trickles slowly back in motion. The gears and orbs of the great wheel slow to a stop.
Did it work?" She questions loudly
Did it work? Did it work." you whisper back
She approaches you a roughs up your hair and leans in closely. 
?_> "Hey" she says in but a whisper as she places her hands upon your shoulders "did it work"
You swallow dryly. Breath in new breath, and pause briefly before answering "I think so
I knew it" she says emotionally
With a light push from her hands reassuringly she yammers orders. 
?_> "We are done here, grab anything that looks precious enough to carry. We make hasteto Andoran"
I cannot" you mutter quietly
What do you mean?" she closes the gap between you once again. Her presence almost overwhelming. Intrusive even. She steps back a bit seeing your displease 
?_> "I have been tasked" you state plainly "I go north
She closes the gap once again. This time more pleasantly. "I go with you then. These treasures matter not, it is you that is important. I go to protect you
Your pause is brief. You know her strengths. And do enjoy her company 
?_> In the night you can rest easy. She could scare the hide off a manticore if need be
I had hoped you would say that" the words spill haphazardly from your craw
A gleeful smile floods her face.
Wait here, just a moment" she says
As she makes way to her companions one last time 
?_> Little time passes and all have their fill of treasures. You bury the wizard together in the damp clearing. Placing his tomb on the loose dirt.
The adventure begins with your first few steps northward. She hacks away vines and bests alike as you make way to the edge of life. 
?_> The grip of winter is set firmly here. It will be days before life is seen again. You press on knowing it is for genuine purpose, and the curiosity to see how a form contains a beast within. 
?_> Or so the tale goes. [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] and any others that might enjoy the read. 
?_> Wrote nearly 15yrs ago in a composition book exactly as I have typed it here. Not many unfixable errors but the context is the opening intro for my homebrew world. The link between all known worlds and beyond. More, so much more is written. I am happy to present it. Finally. 
?_> [@] Spinner of tales, master of worlds. Would you be of so kind a gentleman, if it pleases you, to spend a moment contextually in this realmspace. Thoughts? Wisdom? Thank you good sir in advance. An old tale from a younger mind. The older mind is ready to finalize it.

Sat Oct 06 03:47:39 (Castle Ward, Realmslore, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian)

?_> [@] happy that you are recovering well and continuing to answer #realmslore questions. How deep are Waterdeep’s sewers below the surface and why don’t the main and secondary lines follow the main streets but instead run underneath buildings? 
+_> 1)
The depth of the sewers varies, around the city (for one thing, the city is far from flat, what with Mount Waterdeep and its spur out into Castle Ward, and the plateau that the northern end of the city stands on), but is
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) always below what we real-world modern types might call ‘basement level’ (and to Waterdhavians is “cellar level,” by which they mean one fairly deep level below ground, not several subterranean levels down). It’s important 
+_> 3) bear in mind that a lot of the sewers are flushed out by the ocean tides, coming into the harbor and ebbing out again, aided and abetted by spells cast long ago (by Ahghairon and others) and bound into the wards that help the 
+_> 4) flows of water carry sewage (so the entire harbour doesn’t become a stinking cesspool that sickens the city and kills the resident merfolk).
In our real world, main sewer lines follow the route of streets above them purely for 
+_> 5) ease of construction (and later access). They don’t do this in Waterdeep for two reasons: most of the sewers predate the current layout of the streets (i.e. the streets were different, back then), and because the sewer routes 
+_> 6) are dictated more by where springs rise and flow down to the sea, and where sewers should be sited and sized best for the tidal flushing. .rather than following the routes of streets above them.

?_> [@] One issue I've struggled with when it comes to the longevity of elves is, why would human sages ever have to debate the timing of historical events (such as the fall of Netheril in FR0), when they could simply ask an elf that was alive at the time (or whose parent was). 
+_> [@] Xenaphobia. AS in: the irrational human belief that elves are (always) lying to humans, to manipulate them. This is a deeply-rooted, persistent conspiracy theory.

Thu Aug 30 18:29:29 (Athkatla, Realmslore, Sword Coast, Waterdeep)

?_> [@] So, I haven't poked around, but I'm kinda curious.
Of the great Sword Coast cities, which is most Parisian in its artistic expression, value, and compensation to the arts? Are musical performances still married to rhetoric as in theatre/music? Are modes associated 1/ 
+_> 1)
It varies over time, but Waterdeep has always been most tolerant/varied in style and had the most noble patrons sponsoring art of all sorts. Followed by Athkatla, Baldur’s Gate, and Neverwinter, usually in that order.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Nobles, wealthy ‘wannabe nobles,’ guildmasters, and courtiers (i.e. the Palace) have always commissioned instrumental music for “background pleasantry” during feasts (LOW volume, unlike most “bands” performing in our modern 
+_> 3) real world), and this extends to what we might call “chamber music” performed by quartets or less in passages outside bedchambers, for guests in the early evening (when “retiring” to undress and bathe, before slumber). 
+_> 4)
And beyond fanfares, many musicians hire themselves out to those willing to pay, to play “motifs” announcing their arrival at a function/revel, or even tavern or club. So, no, not exclusively married to rhetoric. 
+_> 5)
However, theatrical performances are the biggest reliable employer of musicians, day in and day out, in Waterdeep and all other Sword Coast cities. Clubs run a close second, as “house bands” and hosting visiting concerts.

Fri Apr 06 03:03:15 (Eveningstar, Realmslore)

?_> [@] Various sources give different descriptions of where the Stonelands start and finish, can you clarify their extent? Regards and best wishes GG 
+_> 1)
They begin at the cliff-edge that the E-W trade road through Eveningstar runs along the bottom/S edge of, and run N to where rocks end and desert sands begin. E and W ends of the Stonelands are far less distinct on a map, but are clear if you're on the ground: 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) they're where the rock ridges and breakneck ravines between them start (both features running roughly E-W). The reason why maps tend to be vague is because no one lives there, and the terrain is so rugged.

?_> [@] Laeral Silverhand, now that Mystra is weaker, can we expect the silver fire in her weakens, or does it work that way? I seem to remember it as a “liquid” kind of stuff that refills and ebbs, especially in Elminster Enraged (if she saves it not as weak?) 
+_> [@] The silver fire is Mystra's essence, and drawn into mortal vessels (like Laeral) from the Weave. It doesn't weaken, but if a mortal is weaker, they can hold less of it. And if Mystra is weaker, she can spare (send to a mortal) less of it.

Sat Jun 30 17:21:31 (Cormyr, Durpar, Raurin, Sossal, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_> [@] [@] Except that's all these places became. Instead of getting the attention, nuance, and development of Cormyr, Waterdeep, Cormanthyr, the Dales or elsewhere, they were reduced to being locations for adventure tourism as opposed to being places to be from and have 1/2 
?_> [@] [@] 2/2 campaigns based out of. And the cracks have gotten worse as the setting has aged and little or no attention has been given to these areas. Or worse, there was stuff like 4e's borderline ethnic cleansing of big chunks of Faerûn; that moved me from player to critical analyst. 
+_> [@] [@] Agreed on both of your points here. And one of the longest, strongest battles I've waged, over the years, has been to cover ALL of the Realms instead of going back to certain areas again and again. The counter-argument was always "Well, we're doing another Waterdeep product  
+_> [@] [@] because we know those sell," to which I'd respond in exasperation, "But you've never DONE a Veldorn/Raurin/Sossal/Var the Golden/Durpar product, so how do you know those WON'T sell?" The response to which was often, "Well, we have to leave SOME areas for DMs to develop on  
+_> [@] [@] their own," and the neglect would continue. Yes, the 4e depiction I am not a fan of, although I gather that the thinking there was "avoid all controversy and potential lost sales by removing all real-world conflicts/disagreement points/elements, and just say this is the way  
+_> [@] [@] this imaginary world is, now can we all just play D&D?" (Gather, because I am not and never have been in-house and sitting in on design meetings.)

Tue Dec 18 18:23:23 (Realmslore, the Realms)

+_> KaylaRPG [@] curious, how would the Faerun pantheon, or various factions react to a wizard actively seeking to gain access to divine magic without the use of faith or religion? 
+_> 1)
Unless a deity had a mischievous reason for aiding the wizard (putting them into a likely ill-fated role as a pawn), they would ignore the attempts, which would end in utter failure. Which is not to say that arcane spells 
+_> 2) can’t be devised (with painstaking experimentation and spellcrafting) that have effects closely echoing certain divine magic spells; the creation of such spells is a tradition in the Realms that’s thousands of years old.

Sat Dec 01 16:01:01 (Realmslore)

?_> [@] Hello ed. I would like some tips I am starting an adventure and I will use as background a sudden rise of Talos to the greater god. It will be in Amn. I will also use Talos champions, called Stormtallons (I like the name of the stories you always post) Any tips? 
+_> 1)
Sure! The only way Talos could truly be seen to rise to greater godhood would be a dramatic rise in destructive storms (Otherwise, how would mortals know? Priests telling the general populace would tend to be ignored because
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) all clergy exalt their deity, much of the time.).
So that would be the first and predominant element; the campaign would involve a storm-ravaged Amn, with storm following storm and the destruction being bad enough that folk 
+_> 3) are looking for magical solutions/protections. Which the church of Talos would proclaim themselves the source of, and send forth their champions. The problem facing said champions, and the priests backing them, is keeping 
+_> 4) themselves in the ‘we are your saviours’ category, as opposed to being blamed for the storms and their destruction (‘Oh, yeah? Why aren’t you stopping all this, then? What’s the good of worshipping Talos when he does THIS? 
+_> 5)
I’m going to find a deity who’ll defeat him, and worship THEM!’). All clergy will be trying to position themselves to take advantage of this. And your concern, as DM/designer, will be: what’s the role of PC adventurers 
+_> 6) in this? (Why them, and not someone else?) As Amn wavers between fearing and hating Talos and all who worship him before all others, and obeying them because of that, or embracing Talos-clergy as saviours.

Thu Mar 08 18:14:35 (Realmslore, Waterdeep, the Deep)

?_> [@] I know private orphanages are kind of a thing of the past in Waterdeep but is there a rough estimate for the operating costs for a small orphanage? 
+_> 1)
So, you would reach your rough estimate by: costs for housing the orphans: building, building upkeep, and taxes (Waterdeep gives tax breaks for temples, which is one reason temples do this, the main reason being divine
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) divine directives, and the selfish reasons being cheap temple labor and supply of future trained priests). The orphans clean and cook and do minor maintenance repairs, under supervision, and their supervisors/minders 
+_> 3) (the official role titles are usually “masters” or “mistresses,” as “keepers” has fallen out of favour) are the priests, who are paid/supported by the temple (out of temple offerings given by the devout). So it usually comes 
+_> 4) down to food costs, and the food is usually filling, and adequate, but not fancy, so 1 sp/head/tenday might cover ALL the overhead (building maintenance, candles and firewood or coal, lamp oil, laundry; the works). For a 
+_> 5) non-temple, private orphanage in Waterdeep, double costs to 2 sp/head, and then round down to a little less, and that’ll cover taxes (they could petition the Lords for a tax break) and occasional payments to guilds for 
+_> 6) skilled repairs like plumbing and mason-work. It’s not frowned upon for orphans to building fires, clean, cook, serve themselves, do dishes and laundry, and maintain their orphanage; it’s expected. (The Realms has no 
+_> 7) child labour laws, nor attitudes to support them.) With that said, a private orphanage owner seeking profit couldn’t “rent out” the labour of orphans in the Deep because of the city’s guilds forbidding it, but could in 
+_> 8/end) non-guilded cities (there are few!). Also, that 2 sp/head estimate does build in a modest profit for operating the orphanage (a “rainy-day” fund if it’s a non-profit). Those who want to make REAL profits might end up with a 3, 4, 5 sp/head rate or more.

I am NOT fine with inaccurate information being spread about how I 'originally created' the Realms to be this or that. The Realms predates D&D by a decade, and my original Realms had no close real-world analogues, cultural or geographic. It DID have a

Q: I dwell in North Ward, Waterdeep. My neighbours’ house and yard are more than unkempt; rats run about amid rotting food, old broken furniture, and the corpses of. .pets? Slain intruders? If I complain, will lawkeepers do

?_> [@] A followup, if I may: what would be the special alloys used by the Imaskari? And is there anything they wouldn't use, in a staff? 
+_> [@] Alloys no one knows how to make in the modern-day Realms, that tend to be light, silvern- or ale-hued, malleable, non-ferrous and therefore resistant to corrosion/rusting, and capable of a lasting smooth glossy finish. 
+_> [@] While it's a mistake to view either the Imaskari or Netherese as monolithic cultures, when they were really groups of very diverse individuals experimenting with magic and "craftwork" in many different ways, there is another, even rarer Imaskari 'tell': mutable runes. 
+_> [@] Mutable runes are something no one else seems to have mastered (Mystra and the current Weavemasters who serve her frown on their use): runes etched into an enchanted item that CHANGE depending on who touches the item: a rune with the powers of X 'melts into' a  
+_> [@] different rune, Y, that has the powers of Y, not of X. One of those runes will be the default rune, that the item reverts to when not grasped, and no one ever managed to layer more than three mutable runes in one item (such items can also bear "fixed" runes). 
+_> [@] The reason this is frowned on today is that the 'sharing space' property of the differing magics makes the item inherently unstable. That is, more likely to break in an explosion that will generate wild magic effects as well as a blast. Adding to mutable item rarity.

?_> [@] [@] [@] I think, and may be wrong, that it is as simple as attracting the attention of the lords, open and the masked. I see it as an invitation only club. Most of the masked lords know who each other are, the open lord knows them all. I think getting invited in is the way. 
+_> [@] [@] [@] 1)
Nicely put. Short answer: any of the Lords (Open or Masked) can nominate a candidate from individuals they have noticed (who are Waterdeep residents), the Lords vote in secret to admit a candidate, and the Open Lord extends a formal invitation AFTER a  
+_> [@] [@] [@] 2) successful vote (which the candidate can refuse). As Masked Lords vary in alignment and interests (beyond the common one of wanting to better their city) they welcome a wide variety of potential new Masked Lords, leading to diversity of membership (and more  
+_> [@] [@] [@] 3) daily conflict within the Lords). Some Open Lords have had a veto over candidates (currently: Laeral doesn't), but all of them can sideline a particular Masked Lord by use of covert agents (who? see DEATH MASKS) or by arresting a Lord for real breaches of law. 
+_> [@] [@] [@] 4)
What WON'T work is being seen to try to become a Lord of Waterdeep. The Watch, the Palace staff, the Open Lord, and the Masked Lords all dislike and shun people who ambitiously strive to become a Lord. It's an onerous duty; they mistrust anyone wanting the title.

?_> [@] I've recently turned 43, so I was wondering if you could shed light on what my favourite three mages, Manshoon, Maaril, and Hesperdan were doing in their 43rd years. As always, thanks GG 
+_> 1) Right, here we go. Sages of the Realms, take note
Hesperdan was 43 in 1106 DR, and though young, was rising in power among dragons. And faring badly against older and more powerful wyrms, several of whom had nearly slain him
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) It was in this year that he first met Elminster, and Hesperdan’s desire to stay alive, revulsion at how paranoid, territorial, and grasping elder dragons he’d met had become, and fascination with humankind, their wizardry 
+_> 3) . .and their society led him to overcome his acquisitive dragon nature and work with Elminster to gain arcane knowledge, to pursue his aim of attaining human shape, living among humans, and participating in his greatest love 
+_> 4) . .of all: intrigue and manipulation. Hesperdan first let Elminster into his mind in this year, and they shared thoughts and experiences. (This was the beginning of their long alliance, which led to Hesperdan later becoming an 
+_> 5) . .embedded spy for Elminster among the ranks of the Zhentarim.
Manshoon was 43 in 1271 DR, when the Zhentarim were a decade old and his hold on power in Zhentil Keep had become absolute. He spent much of this year in seclusion 
+_> 6) . .ostensibly studying magic. Though he did craft some new spells (largely by refining existing spells, and combining stolen elven enchantments in new and more powerful ways), much of this year he spent doing two things: 
+_> 7) . .expanding and improving his private, personal spies both inside and outside the Zhentarim (his watchdogs on Fzoul and Fzoul’s priests, and his scouts to investigate future targets to conquer, such as Darkhold), and making 
+_> 8) . .ever-more-solid pacts with various beholders, to make his aims theirs, and so lessen chances of their betraying or sacrificing him. He also set about a long sideline project of magically enslaving several black dragon 
+_> 9) . .personal steeds. Maaril was 43 in 1360 DR, a year he spent in seclusion in his Dragon Tower in Waterdeep. Or so Waterdhavians thought. In truth, he spent an eventful year traveling the Heartlands in disguise, getting over 
+_> 10) . .heartbreak at the loss of Tarrathra Delthond, his lover and trusted apprentice, taking on a new lover and apprentice (the shapeshifting Woevefril Tannakar) he hoped wouldn’t betray him as Tarrathra had, and rebuffing 
+_> 11) . .overtures from Manshoon to join the Zhentarim (Maaril was irked at the ease and persistence of Manshoon’s spies in finding him wherever he went and whatever guise he assumed, to petition him repeatedly).

?_> [@] So my partner and I were wondering if there was any information we could get about the mysterious deity that Lord Ao refers to as “master? We’re also kind of just being major fans right now and wanted to know if you still play D&D? 
+_> [@] Yes, I still play D&D!
As for the mysterious "master," that being is a mystery to me, too; it was a TSR addition to the Realms, just like Ao. The most popular theory is that Ao reports to you, the Dungeon Master, so you the DM are the "master." But that's speculation.

+_> 1)
The Spellplague and Sundering smashed through existing societies and trade flows like sledgehammers, delaying and creating chaos; a lot of individuals most interested in publishing (printing and distributing) went mad or
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) died. So there was huge disruption and much delay. However, “simple” printing (one-page broadsheets [=newspapers], handbills [advertising], and forms/permits) wasn’t disrupted at all in particular cities or among the 
+_> 3) courtiers of a given realm.
So they went right on, and chapbooks (short booklets) very soon recovered, because they can be collated from pages that are essentially broadsheets (in terms of production, if not content). What 
+_> 4) this meant was that all of the major port cities up and down the Sword Coast and around the Shining Sea, cities of wealth or rallying wealth like the cities of Cormyr and Sembia, and Westgate and Zhentil Keep, and centers of 
+_> 5) books and readership like Derlusk in the Border Kingdoms, had small, hand-operated printing presses that did more than just broadsheets (the first offshoot growth industry? Official letterhead stationery for royalty and 
+_> 6) nobility, then guilds; the second: tickets for attending special events at clubs and fairs) by the 1420s DR, and these became faster, larger (assisted by improvements in making larger sheets of rag and pulp paper) throughout 
+_> 7) the 1400s. Good leather bindings, and page-edge treatments like gilding and waxing, started to appear in Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate in the 1440s, and were swiftly copied elsewhere (the cities of the Tashalar swiftly became 
+_> 8) known for jewel-hued inks and a LOT of gilding, on pages).
By the 1470s, the concept of (for a price) keeping “forms” of previously-printed letterpress pages in warehouses for reprintings caught hold in higher-paying markets 
+_> 9) (often because nobles and other wealthy patrons) wanted to swiftly be able to get new printings of their memoirs to hand out, or little tomes of their philosophies or poetry, or the lyrics and poems of bards they were

DR, and places like Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Derlusk, Baldur’s Gate, and Suzail had local bestsellers and a marketplace of “here’s what’s coming” and “read a chapbook excerpt from the forthcoming new sequel to X by

So Volo is signing copies of his latest as just

Tue Oct 02 11:39:03 (Bhaal, Realmslore, Time of Troubles, the Realms)

?_> [@] Fantastic! Any chance of the pre-time of troubles errata of this? The sociologist in me is now very curious about Bane and . . I’m blanking. 
+_> 1)
Sure. Pre-Time of Troubles: no change to Bhaalists or Myrkulytes, Cyricists of course don’t exist, and:
BANITES were widely feared, because they were not only evil and martial (quick to organized, efficient, ruthless violence),
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) but because they served the Lord of Tyranny by being tyrants to all within reach. For this reason, their urban temples were few except in locales where they locally (secularly) ruled; wherever there were kings or ruling 
+_> 3) lords, they acted against such secular authorities until they prevailed or were ousted.
Clergy of Bane lived in a strict hierarchy, superiors being ruthless to inferiors but never resorting to deceit or trickery, as Bane 
+_> 4) frowned upon deception (not His way or portfolio). Weak (“wavering in faith”) Banites were demoted, cast out, maimed, or slain, but those who capably carried out orders were rewarded with food, drink, diversions, and 
+_> 5) increased rank. From time to time, the Black Lord watched over rising or possibly erratic clergy closely, speaking in their minds and to those of his clergy around them—but then would turn his attention elsewhere for 
+_> 6) frustrating-to-mortals long times, leaving “his rats to gnaw each other,” as Elminster once put it.
The Church of Bane over time became like an army, dwelling in grim black stone-and-painted-steel fortress-temples, its clergy 
+_> 7) being well-armed and having black armor at the ready, and its way of open violence (not intrigue) forcing its daily activities increasingly into a militaristic style. Although it never used our real-world lingo of 
+_> 8)
Operation [Codename],” its endeavours followed the same model, with various priests directly tasked by the god to carry out this or that operation (co-ordinated series of missions), all intended to increase the reach and 
+_> 9) influence of the church; Bane observed the results and rewarded or punished individual priests accordingly.
What kept the Church of the Black Lord from conquering most of the Realms was Bane’s delight (abandoned after his 
+_> 10) return from death, when he saw that this strategy was self-defeating) in pitting his clerics against each other. Pre-Time of Troubles, he encouraged infighting among his clergy, allowing them to form competing sects and 
+_> 11) make war on each other, for he saw this as desirable to eliminate the weak and keep only the strong in his service. (After his return, Bane stamped this out by personally slaying, swiftly and publicly, all who strayed from 
+_> 12) hierarchical obedience, and encouraged a new style in which Banites achieved more through threats and offering non-Banites “carrot and stick” treatment to increase the faith’s reach and influence without open violence.) 
+_> 13)
To sum up: Pre-Time of Troubles Bane was positively gleeful about fomenting and watching infighting in his church; post-Time of Troubles Bane is more about getting and holding on to power, without open warfare but through tyranny.

I know you just recently answered this question for someone else, but I can't seem to find it.
It was about the Realms and real world analogs. You stated along the lines, that you tried to avoid Realms cultures mimicking real world cultures? 
+_> 1)
That's right. The problem is, it jolts some gamers out of immersive roleplaying and into "what I learned in history class about this or that real-world culture" (e.g. "But stirrups weren't in use in ") rather than experiencing the Realms.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
The problem is, TSR's need, back in the day, for a world that would host "Oriental Adventures," 'Arabian Adventures,' jungle adventures, pirate adventures, and so on meant that some TSR designers and artists directly embraced real-world analogues, and presented  
+_> 3) regions of the Realms that way. Resulting in some clumsiness and awkwardness that evokes such gamer questions as, "But how come we have pyramids next door to--?" and suchlike. All of which could have been avoided in favour of a richer FR world that might ECHO  
+_> 4) some real-world elements or historical cultures, without copying them. It's not just jarring for those wanting to roleplay, it's lazy design work that heads us straight at looming consistency problems. 
+_> 5)
However, if emulating a real-world historical culture or even going with the "these real-world people got through a gate into the Realms and now live there" works for you and your campaign, do it! It's whatever floats YOUR boat, as a player, DM, or worldbuilder.

?_> [@] how do you envision the future of Faerun, like if technology progressed (I don’t mean publishing wise), but the in-world future? Tech wise? Skyscrapers? Cars? 
+_> [@] Faerûn has energetic merchants who travel, so goods and tech and thoughts and culture get swiftly shared. In the near future, lots of turmoil as races shoved aside and dominated by ever-breeding humankind see their chances, and try to take them (in the chaotic aftermath of the  
+_> [@] Sundering). We've seen various players (Rage of Dragons) try to seize power, and strife within races (Storm King's Thunder), and your planned Dodkong campaign is another great example of this. With longtime "dampeners" like Larloch and the Srinshee off the stage, there will  
+_> [@] be a lot of bids for power. And the trodden-over-in-the-process common folk, tied to the land, are going to increasingly realize they need to be more self-reliant again (make their own clothes and tools and shelter, not just grow their own food), so they can hastily move if  
+_> [@] need be, and not have to rely on any merchant. Meaning they can close borders and shut others out if they want to. So high-yield gardening, small-forging, and gadgets that make swift processing and preservation of food (pickling, etc.) are going to be increasingly popular 
+_> [@] Handcarts for all, better roads within an area (barony, say) and tolls and guardposts to collect them and control which "outlanders" come in, etc. In the longer term, larger wagons but with much better means of rolling (multiple articulated wheelsets, so a wagon can flex  
+_> [@] and losing one wheel doesn't stop a conveyance, because it travels on eight or more, paired, and carries spares all over the roof. This will in turn lead to both more and better roads, and railways (we already have dwarf and gnome pushcart narrow-gauge mining railroads), and 
+_> [@] urban development along those routes, which when rulers realize this, will mean they push to build good travel networks in their territories, and so on. We will see more and better factories for building supplies (roofing, plumbing first), and then widespread printing and

+_> [@] in the "Wild West" era of magic use, with many competing systems, and still a lot of agency for good old sword-swingers

Hi. It varies from place to place AND season to season (depending on how much fresh produce farmers are harvesting).
Eveningstar has a daily "stalls market" where the two main roads meet, an ongoing "usefuls" market (forks, knives, spoons, bowls, cups, blankets) 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) hosted by (and in the entry hall of) the temple, and a farmers' market once a tenday in the "off season" and twice a tenday during harvest times, with many farmers sending a cart that'll stay until "all gone" not just attend for market day.
Larger places host  
+_> 3) constant markets that swell in size when farmers have lots of produce to sell. When I call a place in the Realms a 'market town,' that's what I mean. Settlements on major trade routes tend to always sell food and drink (intended for travel), and livestock.

+_> 2)everywhere, it is the nature of most to be at least a touch cynical, and so on. Yet to offset that, beings of any one race in most surface locales in the “classic” Realms coverage areas live with a variety of other races, and see “monsters” from time to time, too (albeit mainly 
+_> 3)dead, as wall-trophies). And the effects of magic, if not seeing spells hurled in your presence, is widespread, too.
For reasons of body weight and strength, some professions (smithing, professional soldiery, rowing) tend to be dominated by large-bodied males, but by and large 
+_> 4)(once you get away from Lolth-dominated matriarchies, the Rashemi, and the like) there is gender equality. As in: individuals may be discriminated against on the basis of age/experience, height, hardiness/have all their limbs in working order, and whether or not I like your  
+_> 5)face, BUT there’s no societal bias of role on the basis of gender. There ARE recruiting officers who go looking for guards of a particular build, size, and even hair color, and the units they assemble reflect that. Vangerdahast wanted female War Wizards “implanted” at Court and 
+_> 6)as “house wizards” in the households of the nobility he wanted watched over because he thought they were better at fitting in, acting, and being subtle than his young, ambitious male War Wizards (whom he deployed more in combat/action/military support functions, which is why

Having wealth or status (e.g. nobility) provides a measure of freedom to “be yourself" in every meaning of the word—indulge 
+_> 8)your eccentricites/hobbies, and so on—so we see more nobles habitually doing “odd” things. Wealth allows those without the Art (gift of wielding magic) to hire spellcasting, so they can experiment with changing their own bodies in various ways, having sex while body-flying, and 
+_> 9)so on. Such “freedoms” are limited by disapproval/your own thinking depending on your local society (Sembia is very much “do what you want if you have the coin,” whereas modern-day Zhents are always aware of the Zhentarim and their scrutiny and war-readiness and supremacy of  
+_> 10)wizards and Bane and Zhentarim objectives.
However, magic is most often hired by the non-magical to change their own bodies, usually to make themselves more functional (overcome a withered or malformed or damaged limb, increase handsomeness). More than a few use it to switch 
+_> 11)gender, either to experiment or fulfill themselves (because they don’t feel comfortable as they are) or to escape persecution (by changing looks and often gender and taking on a new identity, sometimes to elude justice). “Everyone” has seen or at least heard of someone doing

+_> 13)the Realms be repelled by discovering someone they have the hots for as one gender was once another. Nor is homosexuality, “swinging both ways” and dwelling in family groups of several “mates” of mixed races and genders frowned upon, societally. Individuals may find it too  
+_> 14)much for themselves to handle, but the laws and general attitudes of society don’t frown on it. There are strict laws regarding inheritance among royalty and nobility, but that’s purely to cut down on strife within powerful families and the resulting chaos.
This is, of course,

In my own background, I grew up in a very wealthy neighborhood filled with people from all over the world temporarily stationed in Canada as executives, and

Hi, Adam!

+_> 3) that I amplified in the later conversations, that gave most of the sentient “monster” races in the game their own homelands or multiple ruled areas (not just humans, dwarves, and elves). [For example, north of the Moonsea 
+_> 4)
Mount Gaethluntar being noted as the home of the flind, and Thar as the “land of the beast-men” = ogres, these being human-drawn maps and reflecting human attitudes.]
My notion was that because of the nature of humans to 
+_> 5) dominate through conflict when they came into constant contact with other races, in terrain they wanted to occupy (as opposed to rugged mountains, or the bottom of the sea), such “monster kingdoms” would be in areas of the 
+_> 6)
Realms either remote from the Sword Coast and Cormyr/Dalelands “human-settled-and-‘civilized’” foci of early Realmsplay, or in undesirable-to-humans terrain like swamps, mountains, really frigid wastes, and deserts. 
+_> 7)
TSR picked up this idea and ran with it (for example, where Troy Denning located the giant realms in his trilogy of novels), in part because it gave adventurers journeys (quests) to reach monster-ruled areas, where ruins or 
+_> 8) monster lairs could be located, full of treasure, without the question arising of why earlier adventurers hadn’t seized the treasure already, if it was just sitting there nearby, in relatively ‘safe’ areas. (I tackled this 
+_> 9) topic in another way by having the Chosen and servitors of Mystra tasked by Her with distributing spell scrolls, spellbooks, and magic items into tombs, ruins, and other places for ‘just anyone’ to find, so as to increase 
+_> 10) the widespread mortal use of magic.)
Veldorn was always ‘the Realm of Monsters’ because it was a land where all sorts of ‘beasts’ lived together in (relative) harmony, whereas around the edges of the map (Evermeet for the 
+_> 11) elves, Luiren for halflings, and so on) there were quite a few “one sort of monster rules here” places. I had hoped that Veldorn would be explored in print a lot more than it was, as a setting that encouraged adventuring 
+_> 12) (as, in another way, the Border Kingdoms and the Bandit Wastes/Bandit Kingdoms do), but there were always projects set elsewhere in the Realms to do first. I wanted Veldorn to have constant vying for power, without all that 
+_> 13) much open bloodshed, because those on top wanted to avoid a widespread bloodbath that would tear the realm apart in utter anarchy, and clamped down whenever anyone got too violent. Which would mean human adventurers, rather than getting torn apart on sight  
+_> 14) as undesirable intruders and/or prey, might be suffered to live longer as pawns, manipulated into doing the specific violence that monsters in their immediate vicinity wanted done, rather than the monsters themselves doing it and being punished for those deeds. 
+_> 15)
The beauty of it all, from a game designer's POV, was that I had gleaned this idea of "Here Be Monsters" in remote areas from ancient real-world maps and the fantasy genre (not just the modern sources, but Amadis of Gaul and all the other romances parodied in  
+_> 16)
Don Quixote) when imagining the Realms before D&D or any other roleplaying games came along. It just seemed fitting that (aside from orcs and other marauders, who "came to you") heroes had to go on long, perilous journeys to reach lands ruled by 'Others

Sun Dec 02 01:54:41 (Madeiron, Masked Lord, Moonshae, Open Lord, Piergeiron, Realmslore, Spellplague, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian)

?_> Gods help me my current pet project has me trying to piece together the history of Waterdeep post-Spellplague, including the fate of the myriad noble houses. RIP my whole entire sanity. [@] I don't suppose you can kick a brother a list of the Open Lords post-Piergeiron? 
+_> 1) PART 1
Of course I can. Here we go, folks
Piergeiron ‘the Paladinson’ became Open Lord of Waterdeep in 1314 DR, and died in office in 1379 DR (of age and ill health, after several assassination attempts at the hands of those
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) increasingly impatient to replace him with their various stooges; one of those attempts claimed the life of his loyal bodyguard, Madeiron Sunderstone, late in 1378 DR).
Piergeiron was succeeded (a month after his death, by 
+_> 3) majority vote of the Masked Lords, after many candidates had been proposed by various Lords, but rejected by others) by (a compromise candidate, initially seen within the Lords and across the city as a caretaker, but who 
+_> 4) won respect while in office) the respected-in-trade Waterdhavian merchant (parchment and paper-maker and bookbinder) Audreithra Teltorna, who was not a Masked Lord.
She held the Lordship until the Spellplague hit in 1385 DR 
+_> 5)
In its tumult, agents of the Xanathar (of the time) succeeded in assassinating Teltorna, intending to install their puppet among the Masked Lords as her replacement.
However, they overplayed their hand, and their candidate 
+_> 6) the shipwright Andramas Rujyntral, was rejected by the Lords. A flurry of assassinations among the Lords followed as the Xanathar’s agents took their revenge and sought to eliminate rival candidates within the Lords and 
+_> 7)
Rujyntral’s most steadfast opponents, but this goaded various Lords to hire adventurers to assassinate both Rujyntral and any of the Xanathar’s agents they could identify and hunt down. They succeeded so well that the 
+_> 8)
Xanathar not only lost Rujyntral, it suffered the loss of so many loyal human agents that it decided to retreat into the shadows, rebuilding its network with slow care and keeping well away from the Masked Lords (a policy 
+_> 9) that remained in force until a new Xanathar succeeded to the title).
The Masked Lords endured a little more than three months without an Open Lord at the helm, until the ravages of the Spellplague demanded that their appointed 
+_> 10) spokesperson (Acting Voice Of the Lords) Watchlord Phulundaera Vantur (a seasoned veteran who’d risen through the ranks; her much-scarred body incorporated magically-bonded limbs and organs from fallen comrades) be adopted 
+_> 11) as the new Open Lord.
Phulundaera was street-wise and gruff and no-nonsense, and the guilds and just plain citizens of the streets loved her, because she stood for equality of treatment under city law and policy, for the 
+_> 12) high and the low. This same quality made her detested by the nobles and ‘wannabe nobles’ nouveau riche, and they tried to arrange many accidents for her. As she was already old and ailing, one such assassination attempt 
+_> 13) finally succeeded, in 1389 DR.
The nobles and the wealthy then spent money and called in favors in ‘the Golden Deluge,’ and succeeded in buying enough votes to put their own candidate into the Open Lordship’s chair: a 
+_> 14) wastrel young noble son named Hauthshaw Assumbar, who had little useful education, even less strength of will (no principles, and a tendency to obey whoever had yelled at him loudest, most recently), and beliefs only in the 
+_> 15) superiority of the nobility and of Waterdeep and of hot buttered snail, to all else. He was intended to be the pawn of the noble houses, but a guildmaster (Hartran Ilandrouth of the Coopers’ Guild) shrewdly sent his 
+_> 16) daughter, Shalantha, to seduce and cozen Assumbar, giving him Ilandrouth’s directions, which were not just promoting guild interests, but were in the main shrewd good governance—but infuriated the nobles, who had coin enough 
+_> 17) to pay for many assassination attempts. They succeeded in poisoning Shalantha fatally and Assumbar enough to frighten him in fleeing the city in disguise, late in 1390 DR, aboard a ship to Mintarn with adventurers 
+_> 18)
He eventually made it to the Moonshaes, but there was recognized and assassinated by someone who thought his death would plunge Waterdeep into confusion and weaken it.
His head was sold to a factor (trade agent) of the 
+_> 19)
Deepwinter noble house of Waterdeep, who sent it back to Waterdeep to prove Assumbar’s demise.
The chest containing Assumbar’s head was opened by the Masked Lords meeting in council in the Palace in 1391 DR, but proved little 
+_> 20) more than an unpleasant anticlimax, as the winter of early 1391 DR had been full of fractious debates to replace Assumbar, with everyone assuming he’d been murdered (Shalantha’s body had been found purple and bloated with 
+_> 21) poison).
As before, the Masked Lords, with many personal interests at stake and many interests across the city seeking to influence them, found it difficult to choose an Open Lord, until one among them 
+_> 22)
Athlynxthlas Ultrumpet, put himself forward with the promise that he’d simply be the mouthpiece of the Lords, deferring all decisions to them, even the traditional magisterial (judging criminals) rulings.

?_> Good Sir [@] someone with an interest in world building (but continuously caught up in minor details), what would your first draft look like?
What is good to, or not to, focus on?
Do you start small and expand? Or with a big map and fill it in? 
+_> 1)
It works differently for all of us, and my own answer is generally: it depends. On what the scope of the project is. Or to put it more simply: what are you using the world you're building for? A series of short stories? A short campaign? A one-shot? Or a home for fiction [:] 
+_> 2) and roleplaying adventures for the rest of your life?
Hint: if the minor details are bogging you down, start with something small, like the first adventure you want to run or first tale you want to tell. Detail the locale it will take place in, AND note "connections to  
+_> 3) elsewhere" baked into the story, like trade routes and caravans faring along them, which mean they're taking surplus goods from somewhere "afar" to places where those same goods (turnips? lumber? cheese? furs?) are in short supply. You can literally draw a "flowchart map

+_> 7)
D&D campaign at the public library I worked at, that became the Knights of Myth Drannor, and began detailing Eveningstar and the Haunted Halls, and very quickly thereafter Shadowdale. When not at the gaming table, I entertained myself describing Cormyr and the Dales 
+_> 8) and then the l-o-o-ong caravan routes through the Heartlands connecting the Sea of Fallen Stars and Moonsea areas with Waterdeep and the Sword Coast. Which gave me the idea for the driving goal of the Zhentarim, and things grew from there. All before the Realms got

+_> 10) this day, and I work on the Realms every single day of my life. BUT your worldbuilding need not be huge or daunting or overwhelming; detail what you need to, as you need to, and let it grow, and it'll be just like living life, one day at a time: smaller, easier tasks you

Hello Ed! Your fan from Latvia here

Okay, here we go:
Both sorts of phoenixes exist in canon, but the non-elemental sort are no longer seen in the Realms, for unknown-to-folk-of-Toril reasons. The elementals come, yes, from the Plane of Fire. [:]

There’s an accurate summary of what history records about the huge orc horde known as the Black Horde here, online: [:]
Like most orc hordes, this one arose due to overpopulation (orcs 
+_> 3) breed fast) in the mountain caverns of the Sword Coast North; when food grows scarce, the young are sent out to sweep south and raid or conquer, forming a horde and usually “getting as far as they can” before being killed off.

According to the original Realms agreement, updates were supposed to add to the history and not rewrite it, but how it’s turned out to work in the real world is that canon is whatever the most recently published source states, so

?_> [@] No need to apologize. I actually respect you even more for this. Personally, I consider you the most credible source of lore on the Realms, since you're its creator, but if they're not your area of expertise, whom do you know is better at answering such a question? 
+_> [@] Here's the problem you're now facing: the best folks to answer such a question would be the current D&D design team ( [@] [@] [@] et al), but TSR and now Wizards of the Coast have long had policies in place, for many very good reasons, of not  
+_> [@] discussing future releases in any specific detail. When it's time to hint or tease at something, or gauge what gamers might or might not want to see, that gets done, yes, but until it's time to publicize something about to come out, you'll quite rightly get silence. D&D is  
+_> [@] a flexible, rich, long-lasting game that can shift in style, tone, and flavour from gaming table to gaming table, so there's never enough design time or wordcount to address everything, so the exciting adventure stuff gets foregrounded, again and again. The sort of lore  
+_> [@] you're after here is by its nature of secondary "adventure excitement," if you will, and that's the sort of lore that gets left up to individual DMs.

Heh, here we go (again*). [* = this has come up a lot, over the years, as various campaigns approach “a PC is on the brink of becoming Baron of the Stonelands”]
The reason the Stonelands is wild, ungoverned country, and Cormyr

The climate is harsh northern (think pre-global warming winter northernmost Michigan, Minnesota, or Ontario, so: ice storms and heavy snowfalls, with howling cold winds). If you’re familiar with Canadian Shield country 
+_> 4) (that is, exposed bedrock), the Stonelands is like that: thin soil with scrub forests, wherever there isn’t exposed rock.
And the topography consists almost entirely of east-west rock ridges, with “breakneck” (steep-sided)

There are lots of prowling monsters, and the Zhentarim have an interest in keeping the area ‘wild’ so no one bothers their east-west trade routes north of (from Cormyr’s POV, “behind”) the Stonelands. There are many

Fri Jun 29 03:08:49 (Cormyr, Moonshae, Realmslore, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_> One of the chief reasons I never contacted [@] about stuff that flashed up problematic or bizarrely shoehorned in or bolted on. On the other hand, it makes me far more curious about the potential development trajectory of the FR had TSR not done what they did. #DnD [:] 
+_> 1)
Me. too
Interestingly, from the very beginning, the published Realms veered away from my 'home' Realms not just because of in-house stuff being bolted on or swapped in (Doug's Albion campaign Moonshaes replacing mine), but because the "home" Realms campaign was dominated.. [:] 
+_> 2) by intrigue and roleplaying (e.g. machinations of noble houses in Cormyr, or the machinations of guilds, nobles, and everybody else in the city in Waterdeep), not dungeon crawling or hack-and-slashing and the published Realms had to not just cater to the  
+_> 3) latter, but centre-stage them, because the game was centered on them back then. So if I'd been controlling the publication of the Realms, all the social issues and power struggles would have dominated wordcount in the products, rather than stats (and, gods  
+_> 4) help us, GOD and avatar stats!). Divine coverage would instead have focused on daily devout life (what do clerics DO?) and what priesthoods are up to in the Realms (like cornering the trade in bat guano or monk-made liqueurs). And all of the racial and gender  
+_> 5) role baggage of the real world just wouldn't have been there, because we'd have the REALMS cultures instead, which game designers and fiction writers could use satirically to comment on real-world issues, but not HAVE real-world issues in the Realms.
So, it's 
+_> 6) very much a 'road not taken' thing, from my viewpoint. Yet I understood what would happen at the outset (Jeff Grubb explicitly warned me that "we'll make changes, and go on making changes, and here's why") and I was and am fine with that: the Realms had to be 
+_> 7) that way, to function as the "unified game world" for D&D 2e that TSR purchased it to be. The good thing was, as it came into their hands with a depth of detail and history and intrigue ready-made, these elements got included, and moved us a step beyond "this  
+_> 8) is the orc kingdom, here's their banner, and they can field X troops" into "this world is ALIVE, and these creatures get their food thus, and defecate it back into the cycle of life so," and moved gaming forward. THAT makes me smile.

Sun Oct 14 19:33:12 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] I know you’ve answered versions of this at other times but invariably the question and, therefore, answer skirt around this a bit:
All specific game mechanics aside –so purely narratively speaking – how do elves experience time?
To clarify: 
+_> 1)
Here’s how I see it for elves in the Realms: from a human POV, any elf they meet, regardless of age, will seem expert in the natural ways of the world, and learned in human history/culture. So, yes, elves are competent in
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) several fields of study and expert in at least one (beyond basics like archery and the care and maintenance of metal weapons and tools) at 120 years. “Sophisticated” is how many humans might describe even an adolescent elf. 
+_> 3)
Whereas to another elf, that same elf is an irresponsible teenager because they’re still whimsical dabblers, ‘flighty’ and inclined to plunge into something new or tired of something and move on without feeling the need to 
+_> 4) shoulder responsibilities, or caring overmuch about consequences. .which elves increasingly do as they get older. In other words, an adolescent elf is still trying new things ‘like mad’ and is an ideal adventurer because they 
+_> 5) have a strong dash of ‘what the heck, why not?’ recklessness and an eagerness to see the world, dare danger, and so on, whereas an older elf is more mindful of their responsibilities/family ties/what will be harmed if they 
+_> 6) get killed.
And in comparison to Ents, who cogitate slowly and make decisions even more slowly, elves have minds that race along, but try to take into consideration all sides and nuances and down-the-road consequences. 
+_> 7)
Not just for themselves or their kin, and not just for a few generations (as more humans consider), but for the entire world and all creatures/ecosystems in it. I’m not saying their world-view is complete, detailed, and 
+_> 8) unflawed, I’m saying that’s the broad scope of their instinctive thinking. With many qualifiers (“we’ll have to see how things look after the first hard winter, and if this, then revise like so, but if that, then. .”).

Tyr WAS blind justice, but recall the history of the two deities (Tyr raising Torm to lesser deity status, abdicating his godhood and portfolios to Torm, then being restored along with all the other gods after the Sundering). Tyr now punishes wrong, above all.

So Tyr is the SPIRIT of the law, and Torm is now the LETTER of the law. (Back in the 1300s DR, Tyr was the letter of the law and Torm was the "what the heck, we're adventurers, we can look the other way" leeway.

The Zhentarim began as a cabal of mages (and others of Zhentil Keep) led by Manshoon making a grab for political power, by allying with local clergy of Bane (led by Fzoul, and obeying his orders rather than those of the

However, as membership changed, over the years, the Zhents saw the need for better Public Relations: a better image for

I mean if it were Waterdeep I could assume things like the wealthy kids 
+_> 1/13) I LOVE these sort of Realmslore questions. So, here are the fads and fashions of the teens in that area at that time (where the “home” Realms campaign is still happily situated):
Item The First: Spreading from Sembia, the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2/13) . .practise of wearing half-cloaks of flame-orange and similar flamboyant, eye-catching hues (and trims). These are off-one-shoulder, diagonally-cut pleated cloaks that descend from the shoulder they’re covering to the

+_> 4/13) . . playacting, “putting on noble airs” when you’re not noble, or “acting the fool, and someone else’s silly idea of nobility to boot” if you are noble. So, a fad that has stuck around for a few years. Signals the wearer’s 
+_> 5/13) . .attitude to all.
Item The Second: Spreading from Marsember: smoking (always with long, slender, ornamented/sculpted into fantastic beast-shapes or other designs cigarette holders, called “longdraws” or just “draws” in the 
+_> 6/13) . .Realms) cigarettes (called “rolldragons”) that are stuffed with perfume-sprinkled herbs. NOT hallucinatory drugs, just local cooking herbs like dried dill and powdered chives, but sprinkled with lavender-water and rose 
+_> 7/13) . .-water and other scented tinctures to change the taste and smell of the smoke. Essence of cherries a favourite. Older generations regard both the use of the longdraws and the use of the scent as effeminate, nonsensical 
+_> 8/13) . .“trying to act like nobles but succeeding only in acting as ridiculous idiots” behaviour.
Item The Third: Spreading from Suzail, the practise of trying to talk like an imaginary, exaggerated version of courtiers or nobles 
+_> 9/13) . .or royalty, with wild overblown phrases and flowery turns of speech and seventy-gold-piece words, usually with bowing and airy hand gestures and with purring or fluting or drawling delivery. Examples: “W-w-w-w-well I DO 
+_> 10/13) . .decl-AY-AH, ’pon my soul, upon my Watching-Gods-smiled-upon-SOUL!” and “Would it ’twere truly time for a fitting epithalamium, and not mere refreshment!” and “A snool and ranivorous luggard, to be sure!” and “His nigh 
+_> 11/13) . .constant absquatulations leave me with crapulence, to say nothing—NOTHING!—of deepening borborygms!”
Item The Fourth: This comes from the Dales, and is just beginning: the collecting of mummified worms and leeches and 
+_> 12/13) . .slugs, posed on flat stones or fragments of wood or bark in little dioramas, often lampooning older members of society. These are traded, displayed on shelves and mantelpieces, giggle over, and the best ones are

Older generations in these regions regard all of this as frivolous idiocy that often crosses the line into insolence. ’Twas ever thus.

?_> Gods help me my current pet project has me trying to piece together the history of Waterdeep post-Spellplague, including the fate of the myriad noble houses. RIP my whole entire sanity. [@] I don't suppose you can kick a brother a list of the Open Lords post-Piergeiron? 
+_> PART 2
The weary Lords agreed to this, and the wily Ultrumpet began his subtle reign. Under the guise of meeting with Lords to learn their will so he could humbly carry it out, he developed the habit of meeting with small
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 24) groups of Lords—meetings that filled most of the days of his forty-odd year reign. Ultrumpet took the Open Lord’s throne in the early summer of 1391 DR, and was assassinated in 1440 DR. The last year of his rule he spent 
+_> 25) surrounded by his personally-hired bodyguards, shut up in the inner room of the Palace, as by then all of the Masked Lords had realized how subtly he’d been steering them (some of them had realized this as long as thirty 
+_> 26) years earlier, but been unable to do much about it). Under Ultrumpet, the nobles and guilds lost power, all citizens saw cleaner and safer streets, everyone paid more taxes but these were raised so slowly and quietly that 
+_> 27) there was little unrest—and more and more real daily power was sapped from the Masked Lords and gathered to the Open Lordship.
Ultrumpet’s slayers were hired by a cabal of nobles, but they merely succeeded where more than two 
+_> 28) dozen earlier assassination attempts mounted by various covert groups of Masked Lords had failed. Fearful of an attempt to wrest power by the nobles, the Masked Lords turned to the general populace to suggest candidates 
+_> 29) causing the expected utter chaos of hundreds of candidates being put forward. However, the Lords plucked a timorous meal-server, a shy young Waterdeep-born woman named Ilmyndra Lhethrus whose quiet but attentive service to 
+_> 30) several Lords’ family members had been appreciated, from among all the tumult of promoted candidates, and installed her, hoping for self-effacing innocence and obedience (a pawn who’d get no sly ideas of her own).
They were 
+_> 31) right, and although Lhethrus hated the role and sickened under the attention and demands, she served well for sixteen years, resigning in 1456 on her deathbed of ‘dragonback fever
Not wanting a return of the tumult or any 
+_> 32) candidate of the guilds or nobles in the Open Lord’s chair, the Masked Lords quickly chose one of their own, the moneylender Fandral Daerakus. Many Lords suspected he’d be unable to resist the temptation to dip into city 
+_> 33) coffers to enrich himself or expand his moneylending business using city funds, and kept close watch over him, employing hired mages and mundane spies—and they were right.
Daerakus attempted to cover up his misdeeds by 
+_> 34) proposing that the city openly lend money to enrich its coffers, under the Open Lord’s direction, but that cut no harbor ice with the Masked Lords, who expelled him for life from the city, not just from the Open Lordship 
+_> 35) late in 1457 DR. (He soon fell in with several unscrupulous traders of Amn who tried to use his inside knowledge of Waterdhavian courtiers and dealings to advance their own enterprises, but they worked through the wrong 
+_> 36) guilds, and didn’t get far.)
The Masked Lords swiftly replaced Daerakus with another of their own, the aging and conservative Malthavyn Thunstone, a stolid, honest, unimaginative stickler-for-details whom no one was enthused 
+_> 37) about but no one was enraged by. Under his steady hand the city flourished, and he lasted until the doddering wits that afflict some in old age led him to resign in 1462 DR.
Thunstone was quickly replaced by another 
+_> 38) citizen-not-of-the-Lords, Hamaera ‘Hammerbrow’ Nalaver, an independent (non-guild-member) designer of cloaks, gowns, and winterwraps of fierce temper, drive, and swift wits. Her rages were many but short-lived, and she held 
+_> 39) no grudges; she might be laughing with someone at supper that she’d shrieked at and thrown things at, nigh highsun. Some loved her, and some hated her, but none were bored by her, and she lasted four years, until dying in 
+_> 40) what almost everyone believes (and the Watchful Order was called in to investigate, and also believed) was a genuine accident—run over by a heavy-laden wagon in Dock Ward late in 1466 DR, after losing her footing in 
+_> 41) fish-slop and sliding under its wheels.
The nobles had been biding their time under her mercurial Open Lordship, and were ready with a candidate of their own and a covert behind-the-scenes vote-buying push to back him 
+_> 42) which quickly succeeded, in large part because their candidate, Dathjet Deepwinter, was an amiable, principled, unambitious, acceptable-to-all young nobleman—who came from a small and not particularly wealthy or encumbered 
+_> 43) (by obligations, debts, or alliances) noble house. Dathjet made mistakes but tried to do what was best for the entire city, and explained his reasonings in open Council, which endeared him to many even when they thought his 
+_> 44) decisions were wrong.
However, he grew dissatisfied with what he saw as his increasing blunders, and resigned early in 1471 DR, surprising most of the city.
The Lords hastily voted one of their own into the Open Lord’s chair

Mon Oct 01 04:13:38 (Clergy and Paladins, Realmslore, the Realms, the Weave)

?_> [@] 2 prt question.
In the realms it seems like the gods have a certain influence shaping folk, but in turn there seems to be a measure of the folk shaping the gods . . if nothing so drastically literal about it as Discworld or even to the extent of Riordan’s stuff 
+_> 1)
Hi! The surgery went well, but the recovery will be long (minimum 8 weeks for the sternum to heal).
Right, here we go with Part 1:
If Tempus found himself worshipped by tribes of goblins, he’d send manifestations of his favor
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) (weapons appearing out of thin air when needed, warhorn calls to rally or retreat when beneficial to the tribe), and his dream-visions sent to sleeping goblins, and visible-to-all waking visions that appear above goblin 
+_> 3) cooking fires or when shamans pray, would show the goblins to themselves executing battle tactics, strategic withdrawals and the like, rather than mob charges and savage but foolish fighting forays. And to other of His 
+_> 4) faithful, Tempus might send images of goblins fighting under the signs of His favour to show them goblins worship him, and he’s fine with that.
Part 2:
Mystra IS the Weave, and in most cases and at most times controls access 
+_> 5) for mortals AND OTHER GODS to the Weave, when attempted by arcane spells (the divine spells used by clerics bypass her and her power, and there are many routes to drawing on the raw energies of the world that are deemed 
+_> 6) magic”). In the Seldarine pantheon, all deities USE magic, and the following have portfolios concerned with magic: Alathrien Druanna (runic and conjuration magic); Darahl Firecloak (earth and fire magic);
Kirith Sotheril 
+_> 7) (divination and enchantment magic); Mythrien Sarath (mythals); Rellavar Danuvien (magics concerned with cold and protection from the elements); Sarula Iliene (water magic); and Ye'Cind (music-based magics, and enchantments). 
+_> 8)
But the main elven deity concerned with magic is the leader of the Seldarine, Corellon Larethian.
So, Mystra versus Corellon Corellon is a greater god, and more powerful than most “human pantheon” greater gods because he has 
+_> 9) less competition among elven deities, and therefore more concentrated power and authority. But this varies over time, as humans rise in collective power and dominance in the world, and the elves wane (though they surge, and 
+_> 10) resurge, hence the variances). However, Mystra was THE greatest deity in the setting, because it is magic-rich and she controlled the access of other gods to the swift, massive power of arcane magic (the fastest route to 
+_> 11) the most smiting power, among “systems” of magic; divine magic eats at the deity using it, but arcane magic draws from the collective well and so doesn’t erode a god’s power unless mishandled).
I say “was” because this is 
+_> 12) where the Overgod (Ao) comes into play, limiting her power. Mystra further lessened her own power by investing her divine essence (silver fire) in mortals (her Chosen; whereas many deities proclaim mortals “Chosen” who are 
+_> 13) their champions or favoured ones or envoys whom they invest with some “superpowers” but can control, Mystra’s Chosen really hold a spark of her divinity within themselves, and so she can destroy them, at the cost of losing 
+_> 14) that essence, but NOT coerce them). This spread out her power and was an insurance policy so that she could arise again, if destroyed, from her scattered sparks of essence. However, every time Mystryl and her successor 
+_> 15)
Mystras “died” and were replaced (such as by the mortal Midnight), the replacement is less experienced than the predecessor, and hence less capable (because they lack a lot of the magical knowledge and experience of a 
+_> 16) previous Mystra).
Moreover, the nature of Mystra is to increase the access of everyone to magic, mortal or divine; she only acts against those who try to use magic to prevent others from having or wielding magic. So she is 
+_> 17) less authoritative and imperious than Corellon, and more generous/accommodating.
So although Mystra is ‘on paper’ mightier than Corellon, it’s not a clear-cut “Mystra beats Corellon” in any situation. Which is a very wordy 
+_> 18) way of saying: the power balance tips back and forth. Most often, their aims and interests are more allied and opposed; disagreements may be over means or style, not end goals, so both deities would be inclined to warn the 
+_> 19) other of pitfalls, but let the other try “another means” of doing something, via servitors and mortals, to see which best succeeds.
Which brings us to the most usual enticements for a human to worship Corellon, or an elf to 
+_> 20) worship Mystra. Most often, they are rooted in personal or family gratitude to a deity for their boons/aid to self or family members or allies/fellow adventurers or neighbours, in life.
And always remember, many deities in 
+_> 21) the Realms happily share. As in, it’s polytheistic, not monotheistic. Aside from clergy and paladins, devotion to just one deity is unusual, not the norm. Devotion to deity’s of one’s own racial pantheon IS the norm, but 
+_> 22) exceptions are many and accepted, not shunned or thought insane or “strange.” If someone said: “Yon (human) wizard holds Corellon dearest, before Mystra,” the response might be: “Oh. What did Corellon do for him, then?” 
+_> 23)
Hope this is of help; Realms forever!!!

+_> Marvel Fan [@] asked: [@] I loved your tweet on Ralauthoarindulglaw. What is the largest Dragon Turtle on Toril? Are there any that could contend with Ralauthoarindulglaw or other such dragons? Thanks!

I’m not sure. There have been reports of very large, very old ‘deep turtles’ that rule clusters of tropical islands, dining at will on the rich fish stocks and reef life. Many seasoned sailors suspect many of the

?_> [@] In Cormyr I know the demihumans are generally well regarded but I can’t help notice none are higher up the social order than Respected Shopkeep. None seem to be members of the noble or royal families. Is this by coincidence or some policy of law/tradition? 
?_> Connectedly I know half-elves are prevalent in the fiction due to their long being a PC race in D&D, and I seem to recall you had a human-halfling (or was it dwarf . . something short) in . . El’s Daughter? (Don’t own a copy, read 10 El books in a week yrs ago) and 
?_> Some game products have referenced human/demi halfs (just a mechanic of 3e I think . . never really played that or 4). But what about demi/demi halfs? An elf-dwarf or halfling-orc? I can imagine they’re rarer but is there anything inherent in Toril’s make up that excludes this? 
+_> 1)
Demi/demis have never been featured in published lore, so the few I've created for the home Realms campaign (elf-dwarf, mainly) have never been "seen." Culturally they'd be rare because of the paucity of opportunities for pairings between certain races.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
In Cormyr, there are fewer dwarf crossbreeds because fewer dwarves because it was dragon territory and then elf territory before the coming of the humans, and fewer elf crossbreeds because the early humans saw the elves as competition to be pushed out or  
+_> 3) shunned, and that "set attitudes." Hence the lack of representation in the royal (one human family line!) and noble families; if a noble family wasn't oldblood or founding, it was ennobled for service to the monarch, which meant courtiers or sponsors or  
+_> 4) military of Cormyrean stock, which again meant human. In recent times, with Vangey's paranoia lessening, and all the upheavals, attitudes have been shifting, so any "keeping bloodlines pure" racist thinking is fading fast.

Yes, they are. Current strength and aims? Up to your DM.
Durnan's first two-shot crossbow (he's owned a succession, down the years) was made by Iros "Ironthorn" Thornan of Port Llast in 1299 DR and later (circa 1302 DR) purchased by Durnan.
Durnan was one 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) of my two original Realms characters that I wrote finished short stories about (as opposed to the single-scene vignettes where I started to flesh out the Seven Sisters), and I saw him as a young, naive "thinking-man's Conan" (Conan from civilization, with a  
+_> 3) a brain, as opposed to a "barbarian") who was best friend and adventuring partner to wily, older Mirt. So he was clearly NOT a "hardened barkeep" to start with; what he was, was someone who had the good sense to retire from adventuring when he struck it  
+_> 4) rich, marry the sweetheart of his youth, and settle down to doing what he loved best (being tavernmaster in a neighbourhood he loved). He has, of course, adopted a "hardened" persona over the years as the best way to deal with difficult patrons; his few close

Spellplague led Mystra to make certain alterations to his longevity that allowed it to survive the onset of the Spellplague (so he could function as an anchor) with the result that he's still vigorous today.
But no, the Wild West tough barkeep was never my  
+_> 7) inspiration for Durnan; you see him that way because the Realms is worked on by many, and "tough barkeep" was a role they saw as perfect for Durnan in adventures they were telling. Which is fine with me.
So long as you don't overlook his "quiet, kindly

Mon Dec 03 04:01:05 (Chauntea, Misty Forest, Realmslore, Tiamat)

+_> Søren K. Wollenberg [@] [@] have been studying the Misty Forest lately, but information is typically scarce. I am aware of the Temple of Chauntea and the locations mentioned in "Rise of Tiamat
Any further features of interest you are capable of sharing? 
+_> 1)
The Misty Forest is one of the more ‘untouched’ forests in that part of the world. So it has no internal roads (no woodcutters have penetrated the interior), and lots of wild game. 
+_> 2)
As far as not-yet-published features of interest go, it offers Reugor’s Rock, the Tombholes, and Dead Glade. 
+_> 3)
Reugor’s Rock is a black standing stone, natural as opposed to erected by any sentient race, an erratic in geological parlance, that marks the entrance to the caverns where the orcs that raid wayfarers on the Trade Way dwell. 
+_> 4)
Pronounced “REW-gore,” it’s about two-thirds of the way ‘down’ the length of the forest from its northern end, not far inside the western edge of the woodland. 
+_> 5)
The Tombholes are narrow cracks in the face of the escarpment that marks the southern edge of the Sword Hills, and extends east halfway through the northern end of the Misty Forest. The score or so of cracks, caused by winter 
+_> 6) ice splitting and slowly widening the cracks over centuries, are barely wide enough for an armored human warrior to walk into, seldom run back more than six paces before they narrow too far to traverse, and are the sites of 
+_> 7) hasty, ancient human burials: fallen adventurers were stuffed into them, fully dressed and with their belongings, which often included treasure—even magic items. Sages suspect the Chosen of Mystra resupply the Tombholes with 
+_> 8) magic from time to time, because burials known to have been plundered have been discovered to hold magic by later searchers. The Tombholes are almost all claimed by small, furry forest beasts as lairs. 
+_> 9)
The Dead Glade is a small clearing deep in the wild heart of the Misty Forest (few agree on just where) in which some sort of ancient, fell magic holds sway. It can readily be recognized by the long-dead, falling-apart 
+_> 10) beholder that hangs in midair above it, reduced to an empty globe of sagging chitin plates and rotting fangs hanging askew; all of its eyestalks have entirely rotted away. It’s not undead, but may serve as shelter for undead. 
+_> 11)
If some adventurers’ tales can be believed, that is. And the magic that holds the remains of the beholder fixed in place makes the flesh of living creatures creep and crawl, and affects them in odd ways that vary from one 
+_> 12) being to another; some have gained darkvision, lasting years, or levitation or other abilities. Just what this magic is, and why it affects living creatures in different ways, are as of this writing unexplained mysteries.

Sun Jul 15 19:18:50 (Cormyr, Dragonreach, Realmslore, Sembia, Suzail, Sword Coast)

?_> [@] I’ve asked after Cormyrian dining habits & novel after novel paints Waterhavian favourites.
What of heartland drink, Ser Greenwood?
I imagine Cormyr & Dales overlap strongly here but what *are* their favourite beverages? Intoxicating, mostly seems wine in books? 
+_> 1)
Hi! In rural Cormyr and the Dales, as most places in the temperate forested-and-agricultural Heartlands, nigh everyone makes “small beer” at home for daily use, and makes wine from local “free” (grown on your land or readily
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) pluckable on common land) ingredients (such as “kruth wine,” which we in our modern world would call “dandelion wine”). Crude “over-the-flames” distillation is common (habitually done by about one in eight people) for making 
+_> 3) medicines/liniments and stronger drink (often mixed with wine or beer or crushed berries as a fortifier rather than drunk “straight” as itself).
Most homemade wines in Cormyr and the Dales are made from wild berries 
+_> 4) (blackberries, raspberries, “wild grape” and the like) or other wild fruit (crabapple wine is a favourite in the Dales and eastern Cormyr). Farmers tend to make melon wine, plum wine, or apple wine (and hard cider), and the 
+_> 5) colloquial collective term for all homemade wines in this part of Faerun is “wildapple wine.” Many of the wines of this region are a light translucent green in hue due to the most popular wine “recipes” combining grapes that 
+_> 6) have skins that impart green hues during maceration, and leaves of various herbs, vines, weeds and other wild plants that do the same thing.
Aside from these green hues, there’s nothing really “different” or characteristic 
+_> 7) about drinkables of this region compared to other temperate Heartland areas; everything varies locally depending on what’s most cheaply or freely (“wild”) available as ingredients (sugars from beets [molasses] or birch wood 
+_> 8) or honey or maple syrup or various plant nectars). For some reason, mead is less popular with younger folk, and more popular with older generations
However, daily drinks in the homes of common folk are almost all broth 
+_> 9) (the warm broth for breakfast is a do-heavy-manual-labour fortifier for all temperate-zone farmers, not just in the Dales) in mornings or chilly evenings, teas and tissanes (herbal or fruit teas) any time of day (and the 
+_> 10) most common/popular beverage, overall), with the various coffee and cocoa variants and equivalents being “acquired tastes” drunk on special occasions or by the slightly more wealthy or by those who’ve traveled far (aside 
+_> 11) from water, the ingredients are more expensive because not local).
Suzail doesn’t have a unique local drinkables scene/preferences; it’s a wealthy, busy, cosmopolitan trading port between Sembia and the Dragonreach, and the 
+_> 12)
Sword Coast, so fads, fashions, and influences swiftly travel back and forth. Residents of Suzail do drink more imported wine because they can readily get it, and because the nobles of Cormyr, all having “city houses” in 
+_> 13)
Suzail even if their main residences are elsewhere, set the tone by what they order in bulk for their cellars and tables. Cormyrean fads and new fashions in matters drinkable and otherwise most often begin in Suzail and 
+_> 14) spread throughout Suzail because merchants are always trying to introduce new things for the Suzailan nobles and wealthy wannabe-nobles to buy—and they are trendsetters for the rest of Cormyr, just as Cormyr and 
+_> 15)
Sembia set trends for the Dales. This has been the overall situation from the mid 1100s DR up to 1500 DR, so applies to your campaign. The recent trend: sherries and almond-flavoured liqueurs from Chessenta and the Vilhon.

That depends more on the individual characters of the two clerics (as people, not in game level terms) and their prior position in the church hierarchy and whether they're personally "in favour" or not, than it does on levels. If "neck-and-neck," then the one

In the 1300s, certain priests spuriously claimed "Soft Frogs" refers to the creatures, rotting away as the result of this or that divine displeasure (i.e. a sign of the power of the deity they serve), but that's entirely fiction.

?_> [@] Knowing that tea in the Realms is basically anything from hot herbal drinks to actual tea from Kara-tur, I was curious if you had recommendations for us on Earth to use for a Realms themed dinner party?

Most merchants and common folk drink what would be sold in our world as "green tea," unless they're drinking a tissane made locally or in that household from freely-available berries.
Realmslore [:]

So if I assume your dinner party emulates the Heartlands, or the Dales, or Waterdeep and environs, most likely would be green tea, followed by wild raspberry tea, blackberry tea, gooseberry tea, and then rosehip tea. 
+_> 3)
If I'm incorrect in that assumption, then the most likely/popular teas would shift to match local sources, with a steady rise in black tea as one moved east across Faerûn. With a few oddities: in Luiren and Veldorn, crickets are added to tea (imparts a nutty  
+_> 4) flavour), and in Chult, certain folk swear by dried snake hatchlings (though as Elminster told me darkly, "I stand not among them").
Nobility and wannabe nobility (nouveau riche wealthy) everywhere like to be exclusive, and drink 'special' teas (secret custom  
+_> 5) blends, chocolate dissolved in tea, and so on, or even mixing tea with liqueurs. (Elminster frowns on THAT, too.)
Hope this is of help!

They vary most depending on race; orcs and half-orcs prefer to eat a diet almost exclusively of meat, and dwarves prefer meat and dark, nutty breads, whereas elves prefer berries and green vegetables.
If you’re traveling
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) in the Realms, and dining in taverns, inns, or eateries, here are four common meals with several ‘removes’ (=courses):
THE WARM BOARD [a solid, respectable meal, served in “good inns” in cities and towns]
Bowls (of 
+_> 3) fire-eggs, of nuts, and of cubed cheeses). “Fire-eggs” are hard-boiled eggs, usually hens’ eggs but sometimes duck eggs, cut in half, with the yolks blended with honey or mustard, then spooned back into the cut halves. 
+_> 4)
Pottage (a soup of yesterday’s leftover meat, with vegetables). Such as: potato, leek, and diced bacon or roast fowl, or ham, leek, and pea, or barley, bean, and goose (or duck, or chicken).
Roast Eel, Tench, or Silverfin 
+_> 5) (in coastal areas) or Rabbit or Grouse or Boar (inland).
Tarts (filled with cherries or berries).
Served with ale and/or “table wine” (a blended dry or semi-dry white or red wine, made locally). 
+_> 6)
SOLID SUPPER [plain but sustaining fare; found in rural way-inns or the best eateries in small towns]
Bowls (of cubed cheeses, squares of honeycomb, and/or dates).
Pottage (a mixed stew of local vegetables and meats 
+_> 7) [whatever can be had, from local rats to the last fragments of smoked, aged carcases of just about anything; often venison]; failing that, simmered broth).
Capon with orange or lemon sauce (chicken stewed in wine, fruit 
+_> 8) and spices) or Boar in Gravy.
Sugared Bread Slices (hardbread/toasted rusks sprinkled with sugar or spread with local berry jams).
Served with small beer or ale.
EVENINGFEAST [expensive, served in superior establishments] 
+_> 9)
Bowls (of chocolate, preserved fruits [jellies], sugared nuts, pickled silverfin or other smallfish, hot snails in butter).
Chilled Fruit Soup (such as strawberry, mandarin oranges, rhubarb). 
+_> 10)
Cucumber Medallions in Vinegar and/or Roasted Marrow Slices in Mulled Wine or Cider.
Cheese Tray (assortment, served with pickled onions, sweet pickles, spiced jams and/or meat marrow, on flavored crackers). 
+_> 11)
Boar Salad (bacon-flake-covered fresh greens, with sliced radishes and root vegetables, drizzled with spiced cider dressing).
First Meat (roast hare and/or stuffed chicken and/or stuffed pigeon, garnished with hard 
+_> 12) boiled eggs spiced with cloves).
Second Meat (roast stag quarter, and/or a whole roast roe deer, and/or a whole roast wild boar, and/or a stuffed-with-pickled-eels sturgeon [ports and coastal areas only]).
First Sweet 
+_> 13) (plums stewed in rose-water and/or fruit tarts: cherry, gooseberry, or other local berries, often stewed in brandy or cordial).
Second Sweet (Sugared pastries [we would call them “shortbread cookies”] or love bites [small 
+_> 14) oval puff pastries filled with lemon cream and glazed with caramel]).
Served with zzar, brandy, port, sherry, and an assortment of light wines and dark beers. 
+_> 15)
SIMPLES [Served in rural places or by those charging little or with impoverished pantries]
Pork pot pies (stuffed with pork, bacon, and onion or leek, and seasoned with salt, pepper, sage, or other spices). 
+_> 16)
Sausages, fried with eggs and/or diced, spiced root vegetables (parsnips, turnips, or potatoes).
Grapes, drenched in a honey glaze.
Served with small beer or ale or homemade “petal” wine (dandelion or other wild weed). 
+_> 17)
Local variations on all of these, of course, depending on what’s available.
For instance, a cheap seaside tavern may serve a fried mash of mixed smallfish, followed by diced pickled herring 
+_> 18) followed by leek-buttered fried slices of hardbread, all washed down with ale. A cheap countryside tavern may serve a “simmer stew” of mixed vegetables and whatever meat can be had (it’ll be brown and dominated by onions).
There we are; hope this is of help. (Realmslore, Zzar, the Realms)

Hi! For years, Moradin was worshipped in the Plinth (the all-faiths temple), but local dwarves preferred their own private cellar chapels, and built them under properties they own, all over the city. Newcomers see dwarves, ask where the nearest temple is, and 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) get taken to one of these. Which is why you won't find one in the lore. Gnomes and halflings tend to be like dwarves in that they prefer private cellar or "upper room" temples, not big stone edifices fronting on public streets. That's for humans. (Realmslore, The Plinth)

?_> *starts reading economic theory to better understand exactly what kind of capitalism [@] referred to when coming up with the Shining Lands*
Like, is it a Liberal market economy or a coordinated one? How much of it is laissez-faire? What kinda 'free market' do they have?

Hmm, being as real-world societies all mean slightly different things when they use terms like “Liberal market” or “laissez-faire” or even “free market” (there’s no such thing as a truly free market if there are governments
Realmslore [:]

The best way to think of the OLD Shining Lands (when Durpar controlled all three countries) was: merchants do as they please and the

?_> [@] [@] That doesn't really explain, though, what they'd mean by say, "last season"or "a few seasons ago". Do they mean it in an approximate sense or does the word actually imply the one season, as in a summer and a fall if they said "two seasons ago"? 
+_> [@] [@] No, "two seasons ago" to a Realms speaker means whatever season the speaker is speaking in at the moment, but two of them in the past. (If it's spring, the speaker means two springs previous, if it's summer, the speaker means two summers before this current one.) 
+_> [@] [@] 2)
It's a colloquialism, not a precise term encompassing a set slice of past time. It might be used when saying, "We haven't had a windstorm this bad for three seasons, at least." to mean: the last bad windstorm was sometime in this same season, but three of them ago.

Published novels & 1e/2e game products let me know suzail & Sembia have quite warm summers, maybe some snow in winter but the picture is fairly fuzzy.

The problem is that published adventures seldom include weather as a factor (in the old days, this was due to a paucity of both rules and available wordcount), so all too often published source material (except when handing players parched desert or howling

>__> is there a case in which Clerics have had their patron deity die, but still receive Cleric abilities without patronage of another deity or using the ritual that allows one to receive powers from dead deities? More or less a truly godless Cleric with no obvious source? Realms deities gain more power with more worshippers, so often when a deity dies, another grants spells to the “orphaned” clerics to gain their devotion. Those clerics may not be aware of the source of the granting for a time. But sooner or later the deity asks for their loyalty.

Alright, let's offer an alternative.

The only logical explanation I can think of is "Some Elder God got pranked with a firecracker, so he\she\it forbade gunpowder

That begs much more important questions about FR:
Does charcoal work the same in FR?
Does sulfur work the same in FR?
Does saltpeter work the same in FR?
Does deflagration work the same in FR? 
+_> 5)
What kind of force prevents people from combining all these? [[enter Ed, putting on sage hat]]
All good questions. Right then, some lore answers:
Gond is the being who banned gunpowder from EXPLODING (burning very rapidly) and igniting (burning with an open flame) 
+_> 6)
He did this because of many deaths among his clergy and most devout lay worshippers, when they experimented with gunpowder whilst creating new mechanisms for the greater glory of Gond. The deity feared he would lose too many followers 
+_> 7) too fast, and frighten all other mortals into shunning his worship. So he tinkered with gunpowder (and later, several other compounds—including nitroglycerin, or “halamda” as it’s known in the Realms to the gnomes who devised it) to 
+_> 8) prevent them from being explosive. Smokepowder is the Realms equivalent of gunpowder; it ignites and explodes because of a magical ingredient that circumvents Gond’s prohibition (and this is acceptable to Gond because the magic is a

NOT-widely-known “secret” and the proportions of ingredients must be precise to make smokepowder that works, so the substance remains rare and expensive and not easily made by “just anyone,” and the manufacture and sale of smokepowder 
+_> 10) by devout of Gond is something Gond can control by holy decrees, protecting most of his clergy while at the same time generating temple income).
So, why do gunpowder and halamda exist in the Realms? They both have other uses in the 
+_> 11)
Realms different from their real-world ones.
Gunpowder, applied as a powder (like dry “meal powder”) polishes all ferrous metals by removing ALL rust from their surfaces. Wetted gunpowder, applied as a paste (usually metal items are 
+_> 12) encased in it; it’s put in a dish or bucket or even a larger cask and the item or items are buried in the paste, so “all sides” are in contact) for a sufficient time, permeates ferrous items to banish all corrosion, no matter how deep, 
+_> 13) so an item removed from the paste is rust free (at that moment, not forever).
Halamda, a clear jelly, permeates living flesh and tissue, and removes all infection/stops rot/neutralizes acids as it is/they are at the moment of contact 
+_> 14) so it halts flesh-eating diseases and decay. It is itself harmlessly edible, and doesn’t “taint” what it’s applied to for human consumption, and so can be used as a preservative for meat and fish being transported long distances to 
+_> 15) serve as food, and to keep viable severed body parts for later surgery, and to preserve evidence/unfamiliar corpses for examination.
Yes, charcoal works the same in FR as our world.
Yes, so does sulfur.
Yes, saltpeter ditto. 
+_> 16)
It does.
Nothing, but if combined in the wrong proportions, they won’t work for much of anything except scorching (as in the real world), and if mixed in the “right” proportions, won’t ignite/explode in the Realms as they do in the 
+_> 17) real world, thanks to Gond’s power. And Mystra’s cooperation; she subsumed his meta-spell shifting what gunpowder does into the Weave, so it now permeates Toril. As does the magic that makes smokepowder work.
To confuse matters further 
+_> 18) gunpowder” has come into use in language in the Realms as another name for smokepowder. Most folk of the Realms have no idea that anything called “gunpowder” explodes and so has weaponized uses in any place called “Earth,” remember

Clearer, I hope. This was a fun trip down Memory Lane, because all of this was covered years and years ago at Milwaukee-era GenCon official

TSR panels; gamers who’d read my gunpowder-related articles in The Dragon always wanted to discuss why they couldn’t have blunderbuss-armed forces making war in the Realms. :}

Hi, Adam! Thanks for the good recovery wishes!
So back in the mists of time, when thinking through the gods of the Realms, I wrote up much lore that didn’t make it into that article.
Realmslore [:]

And can tell you that I saw most of the first layer of ARCADIA as being ruled by the deity Clangeddin Silverbeard, with another part of it ruled by Marduk.
As my conception of the Outer Planes developed detail and depth, I 
+_> 3) envisaged the second layer being ruled by the Mulhorandi (Egyptian) deities (Ra, Isis, Osiris, and Horus-Re), with Azuth SECRETLY controlling conditions in Arcadia from behind the scenes (from his abode on the second layer)

+_> 5)
Marduk repeatedly, and this weakened Savras, so he rarely challenged Azuth. 
+_> 6)
I envisaged ARVANDOR as being ruled by Corellon (holding sway over a fey court of elven deities and visiting mortal supplicants and elf spirits, in a vast forest dominated by trees whose leaves glowed a soft blue in 
+_> 7) moonlight). I saw SUNE as dwelling on the plane, and welcome in Corellon’s court as Hanali Celanil, but possessing an essential personal nature disinterested in ruling, dominance, or authority. 
+_> 8)
I saw the plane of CONCORDANT OPPOSITION as ruled by Oghma, the Binder, as I saw Silvanus tied firmly to the forests of Toril and interested in the cycles of life there (particularly trees). 
+_> 9)
I saw HADES as being ruled by Myrkul, with Shar preferring to reign in the Void—that is, the dark places of all planes, including the Astral Plane/Astral Sea, where the bodies of dead gods float. Shar doesn’t want to be tied 
+_> 10) to any one plane that can be attacked, and that might distract her with obligations or neighbours; she wants to be everywhere, beholden to none—and is attracted to the chaos where planes meet planes, and there is destruction. 
+_> 11)
THE SEVEN HEAVENS I saw as a verdant paradise ruled by Yondalla (Chauntea), with Tyr, Moradin, and others welcome to dwell there unchallenged, and to shape ‘their’ parts of the Heavens as they see fit (Yondalla simply keeps 
+_> 12) growing things thriving, to enshroud and renew the paradise regardless of what others do).

?_> [@] what exactly happened to Manshoon's soul? Since a soul moves into the clone when the caster dies, are Manshoon's clones without souls, or did his soul somehow fracture into each of the clones? Maybe something else?
Things are getting real on Monday morning. 
+_> 1)
Years ago, Mystra offered Manshoon the status of one of her Chosen. (Remember, Mystra is about promoting the use and importance of arcane magic in the world, not about being ‘good’ per se. She does want magic to be available
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) to all, not kept from most by those who have lots of magic or who fear magic. The Manshoon of then Mystra obviously thought suitable to be one of her Chosen; I doubt she’d see the Manshoon of later centuries the same way.) 
+_> 3)
He refused. Readers of my Sage of Shadowdale trilogy can see him refusing again. Nevertheless, Mystra saw him and the Zhentarim as useful and necessary to human use of arcane magic, just as she views Szass Tam and the Red 
+_> 4)
Wizards, or Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood. She saw that the special clone spell he’d devised (Manshoon’s clones are different in the details from clones other wizards create using the ‘standard’ Clone spell) left 
+_> 5) him in grave danger of insanity as bodies died and Manshoon’s sentience moved to new clones, and so quietly used the Weave to store and bolster his soul to make the ‘clone hops’ more stable and Manshoon less erratic and 
+_> 6) dangerous to himself, to the Weave, and to the wider Realms. So his soul is kept in the Weave, and his sentience shifts from clone to clone. His early clones had the memories/experience and mastery of the Art they had when 
+_> 7) created, so every time Manshoon ‘became’ a new clone he’d lost some spells and levels and forgotten recent events in his life (so his every death had a cost). More recently, Mystra’s Weave-work allowed Manshoon to ‘jump 
+_> 8) intact from clone to clone. Manshoon has always had multiple clones in reserve, even after the perilous times when several clones were active at once—in part because of his extensive roster of clones due to his paranoia and 
+_> 9) cunning, and in part because his clones are different than standard clones (hence the 2e rulebooks containing Manshoon’s own clone spell, as distinct from the standard PH clone spell).
Mystra does the same Weave-storage and 
+_> 10) bolstering for Elminster, who in recent decades (as seen in several of my novels) has possessed the bodies of various other living sentient beings. She did it so well that he was able to function in the 
Sage of Shadowdale

+_> 12) themselves, and so functioning as Weave anchors).
And as for the morality of the behaviour of the various archwizards involved, one of the themes explored in my Realms fiction is the sanity of living for centuries, outliving 
+_> 13) our friends, lovers, and even lands several times over; another is the morality of possessing the bodies of others, and the wider morality of “If I have this mighty magical power and someone else doesn’t and they oppose me

SFAIK, there are no official 5e dragonfang swords; they are by their very nature unique items (i.e. you have to source your own dragon's fang). Each will have its own stats (including magical properties, if any). >__>
This is where D&D and other roleplaying games offer fun board games can't: you get to play out the process of attempting to create something unique. Or something your own, like a new kingdom

?_> [@] Ed, im having trouble figuring something out in Neverwinter. Whats the Difference or is there a Difference between the Wintershield Watchmen(SCAG 145) and the Neverwinter guard? Is the Wintershield Watchmen like the City Watch and the NW Guard like the City Guard? 
+_> 1)
There is, and you’ve got it right.
Lord Neverember initially defended Neverwinter with the use of mercenaries, mainly from Mintarn, under General Sabine. They kept order, but tended to be harsh. Meaning the general public
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) soon feared and hated them. So the Wintershield Watchmen were formed (“newly formed” in their mention in SCAG) as a slightly gentler boots-on-the-cobbles police force, directed to try to truly understand the neighbourhoods 
+_> 3) they patrolled, so they’d be more readily accepted and obeyed by the populace and fewer citizens or visiting merchants would end up beaten, maimed, or slain by the “Protectors of the city.” The Neverwinter Guard is the 
+_> 4) city’s military (the same mercenaries, retrained and reorganized over time), responsible for mounted patrols outside the walls, staffing the walls and gates, mastering ballistae and catapults on the battlements to defend the 
+_> 5) harbour and the land immediately around the walls, and so on. Watchmen get trained at arms by veterans of the Guard, and injured Guardsmen do “observer duty” with the Watch, and vice versa, to give everyone broader skills.

Yes, I made this list up. Initially, my dragon names (as distinct from those coined by others) were just pulled off the top of my head, but over the years, I've derived some syllables that 'sound draconic,' and I often incorporate them into dragon names I coin 
Realmslore [:]

+_> [@] [@] It is near a steampunk world, in places. But you're overlooking the amount of chaos all the warfare covered/mentioned/implied in all of the published adventures has caused (Tuigan Crusade, Szass Tam's wars, return of Shade, etc etc etc), the utter upheaval of the Sundering, and 
+_> [@] [@] the ongoing effects of magic. The whole focus of those conversations I was alluding to. Some folk see how they can profit by change, and pursue it. Most folks resist change, and in the Realms that means GUILDS as well as rulers who want to stay on top. Throw in orc hordes  
+_> [@] [@] and the natural chaos of bad harvests/severe winters, hurricanes and so on, and the question could just as validly be put: why hasn't the Realms regressed a long way towards barbarism/local subsistence existence? You're assuming tech is stagnant; it's not, but innovations

Fri May 25 02:33:40 (Mulhorand, Old Empires, Raurin, Realmslore, Sword Coast, Thay, Unther, death tyrant, the Realms)

?_> [@] well met again! Is there anything you can share about your original concept for the "god-kings" of Mulhorand and Unther? I've read that you imagined Mulhorand as a land of dusky-skinned Set worshippers and slavers. How did Set tie-in to the god kings of your Realms? 
+_> 1)
My original Realms had no ancient Egyptian/ancient Babylonia/Gilgamesh elements; "my" Mulhorand and Unther had desert areas and a hot climate and therefore the human inhabitants were darker of skin than the Sword Coast North humans. There were some slavers
Realmlore [:] 
+_> 2) selling criminals, the heavily in debt, and captured outlanders (from Raurin and points east) to Thay as slaves, but neither Mulhorand nor Unther had legal, country-tolerated slavery (whereas Thay did). When I was asked by early GenCon gamers where best to  [@] in" the worship of Set into Faerun, I pointed to Mulhorand and Unther as the best places. Left to my own devices, I would never have had such close real-world (or Hollywood) analogues in the Realms as Old Empires portrayed them to be, but remember that  
+_> 4)
TSR wanted the Realms to be the broad canvas that had room for jungle, pirate, "Oriental," etc. etc. adventures, putting in the Desert of Desolation modules and others, so Mulhorand and Unther became what you see in print. 
+_> 5)
My original Mulhorand and Unther were thus: Unther had broken away from oppressive warring-with-each-other (and pouring conscripted farmers into their armies to do so) Mulhorandi kings: the armies turned on their masters and  
+_> 6) forced independence (breakaway country). Both were remnants of older great (fallen) empires, and were scrabbling in tombs and underground "dungeons" (the cellars of vanished cities) for the treasure (especially magic) of the gone elder glory but making  
+_> 7) little headway because horrific monsters were lurking down there (when D&D came along, I latched onto beholders [with my inventions: death tyrants, as their undead guardians] and mind flayers as the horrific monsters) and because the climates of both Unther  
+_> 8) and Mulhorand were drying, fast; the land was changing from verdant to arid with frightening rapidity (yes, I had climate change in the early 1960s, ahead of my time as usual ;} ). I wanted to explore how a fast environment change forces social change, but. :{

LOVE those broadsheets!
Everyone in the Deep (nobles, guilds, Masked Lords, crime bosses of all species) have long used alternative facts against each other, so it's spot-on. (Laeral will just ignore until forced to do otherwise, thanks to who she is).

She will, however, privately point out the suspicious nature of the published accusations. Certain bribed journalists will likely receive menacing private visits from agents sent by various Masked Lords with priests of Tyr and Watchful Order spellcasters using

Wed Oct 03 01:12:18 (Jergal, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] so the recent deluge of awesome info about dark and mad gods gave me a hankering to sit down with faiths & avatars to idly read.
Until now I’d never read Leira and Lliira consecutively.
With some imagination it’s possible to see them as either 2 aspects 
+_> 1)
You raise some great points about the perils of inquiring too deeply or energetically into the mortal pasts of deities in the Realms. What I can tell you from observed history is that MOST deities have no problem with their
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) own clergy researching and speculating—so long as what the church then tells lay worshippers and outsiders is what the god approves of. (And yes, most of them prefer mystery and “I have existed since before the world began 
+_> 3) to “I was once a short, pimply street thief with pimples who once fell in a sewer and twice got caught stealing plums from street stalls.”)
When it comes to sages and other lay individuals, their ire is reserved for those who 
+_> 4) publish falsehoods or exaggerations/generalizations the god dislikes, or who uncover more of the truth than the deity prefers (most deities being vain, and caring about their image in the minds of all). Such sages may be 
+_> 5) smitten with divine fire or a wasting, wizening curse, struck blind, or scared by visiting servitors of the gods (think of the three Spirits who visit Scrooge in A CHRISTMAS CAROL) who demand that the sage recant, in print 
+_> 6) offering instead THIS approved version—or suffer the fatal consequences of failing to do so. In any case, copies of published works that a deity disapproves of will be hunted down, seized, and destroyed by clergy and devoted 
+_> 7) followers of that deity (sometimes, success at this is part of a novice priest demonstrating their readiness for elevation into “the full priesthood”). Which has, of course, the effect of making the few surviving copies 
+_> 8) valuable, eagerly sought after, and believed by all to be preserving “dark truths that the deity wants suppressed.” (Candlekeep is one likely repository of such “shunned” works, but so are the private libraries of archwizards 
+_> 9) such as Elminster, who can magically hide and trap such reading-chambers so as to safeguard what’s shelved there.)
A curious adventurer who has no intention of publishing or discussing what they find beyond the circle of 
+_> 10) their fellow adventurers will usually NOT be chastised by the god, but manipulated by the god’s agents (servitor creatures and mortal clergy) into “uncovering” what lore the deity wants uncovered, to bolster the image and 
+_> 11) origin story they prefer to be “out there” in the world. This is known among upperpriests as “turning a disbeliever.” The idea is that the adventurer (or amateur whose hobby is an interest in matters divine or a particular 
+_> 12) god) will come to believe in, and spread to the extent they talk to others at all, the view of the deity that the deity prefers the world accept.
Now, as for Bane, I can tell you this: as a mortal, he lived centuries ago 
+_> 13) and upon his death his soul was snatched and stored by Jergal, who Had Plans for his own retirement, and was looking for certain qualities in a successor (in the case of Bane, a quenchless hunger to rule all, and be feared 
+_> 14) by all through the maliciousness and malevolent intentiveness of his rule). [So Bane died long before his ascension to godhood.]

?_> [@] I’m having trouble justifying my paladin of conquest following Sune and belonging to the Brother of the Ruby Rose (Faiths&Avatars 2E). The whole story is here ([:]) -told to ask your opinion. Can Sune’s dogma and Oaths of Conquest work together? 
+_> 1)
Hi!
I agree that at first glance, the “style”/approach to life of a Paladin of Conquest and the nature of Sune as a deity don’t seem to go together. The perils of rolling randomly!
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
However, the deeper issue is that although faith in the Realms or any straight-D&D setting is different in our real world (in that belief is easier, because supported by avatars, divine manifestations, clerical spells that 
+_> 3) work and deities that on occasion act and speak directly to/upon/in the presence of mortals), the role of a paladin has always been one of self-appraisal, trying to follow a code that (except when the deity informs you 
+_> 4) directly) is always open to interpretation, and often involves ongoing conflicts when the interpretations of others (especially clergy of the same deity) differ with the paladin’s own. In short, akin to a believer’s faith 
+_> 5) being tested as in the real world, the path of any paladin is a matter of adjusting performance, and trying to act as one sees the deity desiring.
To do this REQUIRES a chance, in-game, to roleplay situations in which dogma 
+_> 6) will directly inform the paladin’s words and deeds, and if the opportunities don’t arise, the demonstration of dedication to the cause/approach/dogma can’t be made, and that’s not the player’s fault.
In this case, it could be 
+_> 7) argued that the events of Storm King’s Thunder might be a challenge to any Paladin of Conquest (even if Sune wasn’t in the picture at all).
I personally see the Brotherhood of the Ruby Rose more as guardians than conquerors 
+_> 8) and I would see a similar uneasiness in squaring the Paladin of Conquest with the dogma of Sune, but unless a player BOASTED that he or she was choosing that form of paladinhood purely for the game mechanic bennies and 
+_> 9) didn’t care about Sune at all, I’d allow it—AND test the character with in-game situations to see how that particular paladin character made Conquest and Sune’s dogma work together. In other words, add richness to the 
+_> 10) roleplaying with the inherent strain/conflict (it’s a feature, not a bug ;} ). Remember, paladins can fall from grace (I don’t mean into evil villainy, I mean lose their paladinhood), and even (a roleplaying opportunity 
+_> 11) again!) leave one order of paladins to join another that more closely suits who they are or what they’re becoming (with the deity’s approval).
So were I the DM in this situation, I’d let the player try to play a Paladin of 
+_> 12)
Conquest who is a member of the Brotherhood of the Ruby Rose, dedicated to Sune. .and over time provide plenty of roleplaying opportunities for PC development. I do agree that a DM can end up with a nigh-impossible task if a 
+_> 13)
PC party contains all sorts of special oddball characters whose lives, in the setting, couldn’t easily be lived together. .but the fun in life lies in the challenges, the expanding of horizons, the stepping out of the safe 
+_> 14) and familiar—or it becomes mere existence, not life.

?_> [@] Oh wow, thanks so much for that early Realms insight. I should clarify that when I said I'm attempting to run a "pre-TSR" Realms I meant the Realms just prior to you selling it to TSR. So basically the Realms as it stood in your original lore turn-over to TSR in '86. 
?_> [@] That's especially interesting that Sune was in the Realms so early on. My favorite PC is a Sunite, so I'm always eager for Sune lore

Okay, here’s some early Sune lore for you.
Sune watched over her temple guards, and champions fighting on her behalf (including adventurers), and from time to time would manifest to bolster their armor class, hit points

+_> 4) off a glow as if it was aflame (though it very rarely was). Sune could send actual fire through her hair to start a fire if her faithful were shivering of cold and firewood was frozen, or similar situations, but very rarely 
+_> 5) did this to aid combat, aside from burning trolls.
Sune is very fond of sending inspiring images of great beauty (crafted items and nature, not just sensual) and music to her faithful, in dream-visions.

A couple of questions, if I may 
Who built the East Way? When? Why does it go through Hullack Forest instead of skirting the edges? I presume the woods were as deadly back then as they are now? 
+_> 1)
The Forest was as deadly back then, but much larger (i.e. there was no skirting it except by climbing mountains; they filled that corner of Cormyr). The East Way took years to blaze and clear and expand, in stages, starting circa 176 DR or so (the Sembian end
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) from Yhaunn to Ordulin, was first, but not envisaged as a road linking with Cormyr). Woodcutters, sponsored by interests in Aravel that wanted their own supporting farms, started east from Arabel in 192 DR, and blazed a trail (a pack trail, not a wagon road)  
+_> 3) to the border by 198 DR. The rest came in fits and starts, mainly pushing east from Cormyr, over the next few decades. For a long time, it was a trail with fords, not a proper wagon road, and was perilous in the extreme (monsters used it as a banqueting

What sorts of notions do these master part poopers hold dear in places like Cormyr? Waterdeep? 
+_> 1) Right, here we go.
Although it’s inaccurate, rude, and can be frankly dangerous to regard the nobility of either Cormyr or Waterdeep as monolithic, sharing a consistent mindset, moral code, and views (in reality, their
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) . .wealth or former wealth has led them to indulge their personal eccentricities to a degree that makes them more varied than any other social class in the Realms), the truly crusty (but unstintingly eloquent) Aunt Agatha/Lady 
+_> 3) . .Bracknell party poopers tend to believe these things:
Humans are the only TRULY cultured race, and their customs and decisions should hold sway. Even elves and dragons, who may be ancient and PRETEND to sophistication 
+_> 4) . .screwed up badly and so demonstrated their essential unfitness to Be First. WE are First, and rightly so.
Highborn humans are the most cultured of humans; they have grown up surrounded by the ‘right views,’ and so are the 
+_> 5) . .most fit to rule. The highborn are the “betters,” and less wellborn are the “lesser,” even if they marry into the nobility ro acquire great wealth, they can never quite overcome the ghastly misfortune of their low birth. 
+_> 6) The gods ordain that the highborn should have power over others, and decide things for them. Gods who do not are mistaken, or are not gods. Priests of gods who hold to any other view are deluded fools, or charlatans who were 
+_> 7) . .never true believers in their first place, and so are unworthy of their offices.
Society advances through experimentation, so nobles who do odd things are to be tolerated (criticized and hampered, but tolerated) unless they 
+_> 8) . .seek to end the status of all nobles, in which case they are mad and must be exterminated lest they endanger high society/the natural order of things/the good of all humankind/all life in the multiverse. So a noble who 
+_> 9) . .lowers themselves to try a life of poverty or consorting habitually with commoners or to indulge in unusual religious antics is lost to us, but to be humored and exploited as a source of entertainment (something to gossip 
+_> 10) . .about, at least). They may mistakenly think they are ‘broadening themselves,’ but may be moved by the gods to bring about some necessary cultural change or other, at personal cost. Their activities may even be wagered 
+_> 11) . .upon without loss of style.
Debauchery is something lower orders indulge in. Nobles who engage in similar activities are merely expressing themselves, or giving vent to innate animal spirits that are personal flaws. 
+_> 12) Hopefully they’ll come to their senses before they break all the feather dusters or utterly terrify the horses.
Generosity to the lower classes is not a flaw unless carried to extremes; rather, it is necessary lubricant to 
+_> 13) . .keep the lower classes from rising up against us and ruining everything. They can and should be bought, and it is good that someone other than me is out of their minds enough to distribute largesse so that I need not. 
+_> 14) Having a sense of humor that one indulges at the expense of one’s elders and betters, rather than kicking the behinds of the lowborn and especially lowborn social climbers and pretenders, is a flaw. One should not poke fun 
+_> 15) . .at those better and more experienced than oneself. This is the besetting sin of our straying younglings. Anyone who has too much to do with magic is mad, and dangerous, and to be thwarted. Streaks of madness, allowed to 
+_> 16) . .rule those who possess them unchecked, will inevitably lead to the ruin not just of their individual, but of their house. Divert them. Young men/women or gambling will usually suffice.
Being amiable and good-natured is a

+_> 18) . .but forgive few slights and forget none at all. Laughing at your elders is insolence, no matter how it is passed off. Such behaviour is to be avenged. Comeuppances should never be far away; I recommend the salted horsewhip. 
+_> 19) Though not for Lord Jhalast, as he enjoys it.
And there you have it. Ah, but I should write a play or two. .in my SPARE time

I’d say your overview impression is spot-on for the Realms. An elf tends to trust another elf, even one obviously of ‘another sort,’ over non-elves because they know the strange elf fundamentally understands them; elves

In general; in specifics, elves are as diverse as humans.
So, yes, there are sociological differences between wild elves from different regions. They embrace/live

?_> [@] 
RE Azoun IV’s reign. May we get a clear picture of a noble heir being Presented To The King?
I know of glimpses, Cormyr for example (“Moderation, my leige?” 😂💖)
But I’m not aware of a detailed scene.
Related tangent, how formalised was any 
+_> 1)
Hi! During Azoun’s reign, “being presented at Court” is indeed the correct phrase in Cormyr. The same process applied to everyone of noble birth, not just heirs, and was twofold. Young person, when THEY feel ready (unless
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) they pass their 22nd birthday without doing this, whereupon an envoy escorted by a Highknight and a War Wizard will come to them, to enquire why), will request an audience. Usually the request is conveyed through a parent 
+_> 3) (or older relative than the young person, if death or ill health prevents a parent doing so), and the parent accompanies them to Court.
Where they have a private meeting with a clerk of the Court (again, backed by a 
+_> 4)
Highknight and a War Wizard, plus a second hidden War Wizard who’ll use magic to detect falsehoods when they want to) about their personal aims, interests/hobbies, what they’d like to see change in the realm, what they like 
+_> 5) and want to preserve unchanged in the realm, and where they see their own life heading over the next two decades. This meeting takes place in the Royal Court building.
Then, later the same day, or the next day if the King is 
+_> 6) really busy (if the King is away, the first appointment won’t be made until he is), they have a private audience with the King (who is protected via spells, including a wall of force if need be, by Vangey or Laspeera or 
+_> 7) another of the most senior War Wizards, in adjacent hiding (in a chamber linked via a secret door and spyholes with the audience chamber; there are six suitable small audience chambers in the Palace, which is where THIS 
+_> 8) meeting takes place. Azoun just wants to share some wine or tea and biscuits or “smallbites” (canapes) with the young person and get to know them; he’ll be friendly and informal, but try to learn enough of their true 
+_> 9) character to take his measure of them. Ideally, he wants this “moot” to end with the young person regarding their King as a friend.
In all cases, if the King is unavailable for extended periods (this befell very rarely)

Aulauth = flower, blossom
Hence aulauthspir = rose
So Blackrose is usually rendered “Narlauthspir” but over time, SOME usages of the surname have been corrupted/shortened into Nalauthspir or Nauthspir or even Nothspir/Nothspir/Nuthspur 
+_> P.S. Many elves who live and work among humans (i.e. members of an adventuring band) adopt a “humans can call me this” surname that’s a portmanteau of a hue and a living thing/natural feature (like Blackrose, or Bluewater).

Heh. I first covered this in issue 37 of The Dragon, in my Gates article. Which, having footnotes, so impressed the staff that they offered me a Contributing Editor position (which I accepted). The answer is "yes" to all of your questions, BUT I've always left

I can say that Eric L. Boyd and others penned various articles for the Wizards website, over the years, that dealt with specific gates; one series of articles featured a different gate of the Realms in each instalment.

Sat Feb 03 16:32:11 (Manshoon, Moonsea, Realmslore, Sword Coast, Zhentarim, the Realms)

?_> [@] Thanks, Ed. I see that the Realms are low technology despite having the resources and geniuses to be more advanced in that regard than they currently are
Is there any reason for this? 
+_> 1) Sure. Wars, diseases, food shortages, and magic. Those on top currently wanting to stay there. So many inventors get attacked, their work destroyed, or more often seized by a local ruler/powerful person who wants it for themselves. Meaning it doesn't get into 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) widespread distribution, which is the key step in advancing tech. Magic is "easier" and already available, for heavy hitting. Experimentation is dangerous. Really transformative tech, like a widespread system of really good roads, water purification and  
+_> 3) pumping, etc. is a LOT of hard work and prohibitively expensive for almost everyone short of governing rulers who are already on top and mistrust transformative change because it could threaten their status. BUT the Realms is on the brink of surging ahead  
+_> 4) in technology in a lot of places. That's one of the reasons play and tales are set "now," in this era of quickening change, a time that "matters." We've had Realms novels ( [@] penned the Watercourse trilogy) that looked at big engineering projects  
+_> 5) and many books (for example, The City of the Dead novel by [@] ) that look at social change happening before our eyes. It's up to individual DMs if something big "happens" in their Realms campaigns; we're leaving the agency to you. You can build  
+_> 6) the rail lines that cross continents. Look at the Zhentarim; they began as a way for Manshoon and cronies to seize local power (in Zhentil Keep), but the reward he was offering to the mages who joined was wealth thanks to cornering the shortest/fastest/most  
+_> 7) profitable trade route between the mineral-rich Moonsea North and the Sword Coast's markets and food and textiles. Look at the Zhentarim again and how they got sidetracked into internal strife and other goals. Life has a habit of doing that to endeavours 
+_> 8) which is why tech levels have for so long ebbed and flowed near the brink of a big surge forward.
Over to you, and Realms roleplayers everywhere, to see if the advances happen.

Sun Apr 22 22:07:23 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] Friend Ed, this day I am interested in hin magic. I am quite interested in stuff that appeals to halflings and no one else, especially unique goodies and non-weapons. I looked at the stuff in The Five Shires, but it wasn't what I wanted. Thankee! 
+_> 1)
In the Realms, hin daily magic is most concerned with growing things (edible plants, usually, and hin specialize in prettily flowering edibles), training growing things, and banishing blights and molds from growing things. Second comes cleaning: hin are 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) foremost, as a race, when it comes to small, simple spells that cleanse things and remove marks, stains, etc. Third is mending: hin are great at magic that consumes a raw material (material component) and uses it to knit tears or cuts or frayed areas, restore  
+_> 3) worn-out fabric or rusted metal (turning things to "like new" condition BUT THE LOOKS THE CASTER WANTS, so if a mended garment or awning is faded, the "fixed" part will match unless the caster wants the whole thing to look new and rich again). And fourth is  
+_> 4) warding magics, that keep away unwanted intruders (of specific sorts determined by the incantation) and combine alarms and lighting if the caster wants them; i.e. makes it hard for a prowling predator to cross a ward-boundary around a tent or hin campfire, and 
+_> 5) brilliant lights the area (the boundary radiating light that due to the enchantment makes invisible beings visible, plus an audible alarm to awaken sleeping hin), and so on. Sixth is tracer magics (like Locate Object, but keyed to a favourite specific item  
+_> 6) that's been lost or stolen, so the caster can find it again. Seventh: building surfaces; hin enchantments can make mud brick waterproof, keep oil-mix seals from leaking, and so on, to make simple construction sturdier and more long-lasting. See? Practical stuff. 
+_> 7)
Many hin make livings partly by using such magics; they dwell in human-dominated cities and towns and run "repair shops" for humans needing things fixed or cleaned or mended. Or by selling fresh greens (or berries, small tomatoes, herbs, or fruit) for many tables.

Creatures knew their alignment if clerics told them (having used know alignment spells). Alignment tongue is a shorthand code, not a full, expressive language; can be used to identify others of same alignment if they understand what you're saying; it's a way of

+_> 2) sharing concepts/dogma central to a particular alignment (e.g. "obedience to order stultifies" or "all things are best balanced"), and must be recognized to 'unlock' it in your head. So divinely bestowed but asleep until used. I asked Gary Gygax about it back

?_> 1)
Heh. I've been asked this many times before, and although part of me wonders what's the point of all "who's more powerful?" questions, the answer is: it depends. In terms of raw personal BATTLE power, the answer is likely Vecna. Though so much of his power is 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) vested in his Hand and his Eye that unless they can all be in one place, Larloch might pack more punch. Not that he would fight toe-to-toe in battle, because that isn't Larloch's way; he views liches who do that as idiot failures. Larloch's way is to  
+_> 3) manipulate from behind the scenes to lead anyone seeking him, or trying to cross him, astray, so they never come into contact with him. If need be, he'd hurl his many, many servitor liches at them, most of whom are personally more powerful than Acererak. 
+_> 4)
Larloch and Vecna both have a wider reach and influence on the worlds around them than Acererak, so if you're measuring that way, Acererak is left behind. But when it comes to measuring Larloch and Vecna against each other in terms of influence, it's a matter of  
+_> 5) style: Vecna has the greater fear-reputation and is "noisier," and Larloch is more the master manipulator, who works unseen. As in, you may never know how much he's affected you. I can only go by what Elminster (and on rare occasions Storm, or Laeral, or  
+_> 6)
Volo[!]) tell me of the Realms, and the three Chosen of Mystra all think Larloch (even wherever he is now, bested by the Srinshee) is the greater threat. As El put it, "Vecna is a bogeyman, and his relics do harm. Larloch undresses thee and ye never even  
+_> 7) know it." Larloch plays the longer game, and is more patient and empathic and has a greater understanding of the multiverse, whereas Vecna is more self-centered. I trust El's judgment, because I must; without it, none of us know ANYTHING about the Realms.

+_> [@] The Sarrukh fitting better is the work of master Realms lorelords Eric L. Boyd and George Krashos, who KNOW the Realms and craft lore additions and clarifications that therefore feel like/read like the Realms. Seamlessly. (And are always at work on more Realmslore for us all.) 
+_> [@] Brian Cortijo does the same thing for the Realms, mostly but by no means exclusively in Cormyr, as do many "official" designers and fiction writers, and longtime fans like Jeremy Grenemyer. There's a long list of talented folk who "get" the Realms (Erik's on it!), and they and

Sat Feb 03 02:50:51 (Cormyr, Realmslore, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_> [@] Wow! Thank you!
I’d seen an answer to sexuality on Candlekeep ages back. But this goes way deeper.
Given your mention of those strict inherence rules for nobles: how’s the order go for a noble heir who’s gay? Their heir apparent is . . eldest nibling? What if they adopt? 
+_> 1) It varies widely across the Realms, depending either on tradition within those families, or the laws of the realm they're nobles of (same as in the real world: some noble titles descend through the male line, some through female, and so on). Back when I was five 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) or six and first thinking these things through for the Realms, I had to decide what would happen if folk could magically be brought back to life, and decided that to prevent "eternal kings" who just keep getting resurrected or reign as liches, death would  
+_> 3) knock an individual out of the succession (and we see that in Cormyr: A Novel). In some families, a returned-from-death person would still be considered part of the family and could conceivably "re-inherit" if they were the only one left standing after all  
+_> 4) other kin died off, while in other cases, particularly if the dead were nasty or unpopular, they would be shunned and kicked out of the family). So the first answer is: it depends. Let's look at Waterdeep and Cormyr, the two gatherings of nobility most seen  
+_> 5) published Realmslore to date. So: a noble heir who happens to be gay is still the noble heir; they still inherit. If they die without "issue of their body," the succession passes to their next eldest kin (in some families, of a particular gender; in most 
+_> 6) gender doesn't matter except in rare cases of twins born at the same moment, in which case there's usually a standing family rule of boy first or girl first; if not, the family would pray to a god of the head of the house's choice for vision-guidance, unless  
+_> 7) the REALM had a law/rule about this). Adopted children are still noble, but aren't in the succession (they stand outside of it and get "passed over"). For royalty, there are ALWAYS complicated laws, formed by royal decrees over the years that the nobility of  
+_> 8) the realm support (when they don't, that's when you get civil war and usurpers supported by strong noble factions, and the "new monarch" is usually pressed to issue new decrees making everything clearer and as the majority of the nobles want it). I have left  
+_> 9) the details of such laws and customs of succession as murky as possible to allow Realms novelists and game designers and individual DMs down the year maximum freedom for storytelling/PC "stakes." If you'd like a model for how to govern in cases of "which of  
+_> 10) two or three seemingly-equal candidates should inherit, consider first what Jeff and I showed in Cormyr: A Novel of someone not wanting the kingship abdicating in favor of a sibling, then turn to glance at the NFL. Yes, the American professional football  
+_> 11) league. On their website, before the playoffs/postseason, there's always a link to "tie-breaking procedures" or some such that demonstrates how they decide between two teams that finish with the same points. It's always intrigued me that in the end, after  
+_> 12) factors are exhausted, it comes down to a coin toss. In the Realms, there'd never be a coin toss; that would be the point at which it would be handed to the gods, to send a sign. (Which, yes, might mean clergy faking something or twisting an interpretation 
+_> 13) but no system is perfect. It's in the conflict and vying for power that many storytelling/roleplaying adventure possibilities arise, after all. Note that in the Realms as in real life, there have been many instances of gay persons managing somehow to have  
+_> 14) offspring in the usual way, so as not to endanger the succession (they are reared that the maintenance of their house [family] comes before all else, and in most cases would believe and follow that, no matter their personal losses/costs).

It has, or used to have a nearby glazier, but also volcanoes and deserts.

Hi, Anna. This has been asked a time or two. The derivation isn't from Tolkien (I never saw Waterdeep as a place that would have a king, or many dwarves, for that matter). The derivation is much simpler: as Mirt swindled his way south along the Sword Coast back in 1966, I  
+_> [@] [@] 2) knew he was approaching the best harbor in the northern part of the Sword Coast. A really good harbor is sheltered from previaling storms (in this case, by a mountain), and has deep water right up close to shore, so large ships can dock and so sailors don't have to worry  
+_> [@] [@] 3) about running aground on shoals or sandbars in foggy conditions (and shores have lots of fog, due to temp differences between land and sea). So as I was writing my Mirt tales (about a decade before D&D existed), I gave this place a "placeholder" name of Deepwater. Which  
+_> [@] [@] 4) sounded more like a tidewater port in Maine than a place in a medieval-cum-Renaissance fantasy setting, so that name wouldn't do. but what if I just turned it around, from "Deepwater" to "Waterdeep"? YES. So, Waterdeep it became.

Yes, lore about the cuisine of the Moonstone Mask in particular. Let me summarize, because that lore amplifies the twin themes of local Neverwinter cuisine: fish and marine edibles in hot soups, sauces, and broths, and the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) serving of hot savoury pies and sweet dessert tarts.
Augmented by hot meat dishes (roast boar, fowl, and oxen cooked on spits) and crusty handloaves of bread spiced with garlic or nuts, and served with cheeses).

With sides such as fried dulce (seaweed), mushrooms doused in herb-and-garlic sauce, and scallions and fennel soaked in a parsley-and-mint chicken broth. 
+_> 4)
Popular examples of the marine viands: mussel-and-basil soup, chowders, turtle soup, and octopus broth. Places like the Mask would serve signature dishes like the Mask’s Daintyfish dish: twenty tiny fish known as 
+_> 5) silverflashes, slid onto a single skewer, dipped in herbed butter, and sizzled over a flame until crunchy. 
+_> 6)
The hot pies served in Neverwinter tended to be boar, veal, bacon and kidney (lamb’s kidneys preferred), chicken liver, or goat. Poorer folk ate eel pies, lamprey pies, fish pies, or rabbit pies. 
+_> 7)
Sweet pies were usually made and served in grander houses or commercial eateries, and were dominated by sugar and fruits, such as blackberry-and-apple pies, topped with cream and sliced almonds. 
+_> 8)
In inns, taverns, and the kitchens of private homes, small “hand tarts” (palm-sized) were usually produced, and these tended to have fillings of gooseberries, and almonds. 
+_> 9)
As a special treat, when chocolate was available, strawberries might be served, each fruit in a chilled chocolate coating.
Hope this is of help.

Secrets of Saerloon 1: The many small gnome and human family firms who make various cast alloy items (collectively “pewter”) have had suspicions swirling around them for years, mainly of smuggling (small valuable items encased

Secrets of Saerloon 2: In the wake of the sudden disappearance (likely assassination) of Lord Governor Haelta “Johannes” Jauhanneszlan, not only did the Netherese influence over the city fade almost overnight (after the

Secrets of Saerloon 3: Fire recently broke out at the Mavnurathan family shipyard and destroyed two caravels under construction. A sword was seen to rise up out of the ashes and fly away—into the heart of the city. 
+_> 7)
So what was a magical blade doing aboard a half-finished hull usually a-swarm with workers? Where did it go, who has it now, and what are its powers? 
+_> 8)
Secrets of Saerloon 4: Two of the quietest “old coin” merchant families of Saerloon are the houses of Harandreth (who have holdings all over the Dragon Coast and Vilhon Reach ports) and Ponszcelam (known as jewelers and 
+_> 9) dealers in luxury furniture, hangings, and furnishings of all kinds). Although both were rumored to have been working closely with the Netherese, both are now believed to have sponsored the removal of the Lord Governor, and

But just to be clear, you're saying that your Unther & Mulhorand were ruled by mortal kings as opposed to "god-kings"? If so, I'm a bit surprised, since the god-kings are mentioned as early as FR0 but then again so is Kara-tur.

Shar (chaos, discord) backed both, to bring about the downfall of mighty Mulhorand and succeeded: Unther broke away into independence.

?_> [@] [@] Ed, thank you so much for indulging my curiousity, but this now brings up another question. Since gods hear whenever their name is spoken (as a kind of cacophonous white noise), doesn’t that confuse things if the god’s name is the same as a common word, like “soon” or “mask”?

Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2/3) a lot that gods might otherwise punish. (You might say the art of being an effective god is mastery of multitasking.) Please note: when a deity's name is uttered in prayer, in a temple, while clutching a holy symbol, or by a paladin or someone making a  [@] sacrifice/offering, it "sounds different" to divine ears (and so can be told apart from other utterances and soundalikes, so someone saying "mask that before you paint the trim" or "The bread'll be done soon" isn't heard by those deities in the same tone as their names).

Sun Mar 11 15:48:59 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] Hey, Ed! I have a huge issue that is generating controversy in a group of mine. The 5E PHB states that a Paladin does not need to serve any God: just staying true to his Oath is enough to get/keep his powers. But as for FR, does a Paladin need to *SERVE* a God/Deity? 
+_> 1)
One becomes a paladin by hearing and accepting a call to holy service. That acceptance is cemented by an oath. If a paladin transgresses against their oath, the usual absolution, as the PHB states, is to seek absolution
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) from a cleric of the same faith. Paladins DO worship deities, and like any other mortal, may receive requests from mortal priests or divine servitors, or messages directly from a deity (usually through dream-visions, or 
+_> 3) literal visions appearing to a praying paladin). So although paladins by their very nature are semi-independent agents, fighting evil as adventurers rather than being temple guards, they DO serve deities. Being a cleric or 
+_> 4) a paladin in the Realms is NOT “doing what you want as an armored killer but also having healing spells because some god likes your ilk.” Although you, as a paladin, serve a god or alliance of good gods (to literally fight 
+_> 5) evil, and do so largely ‘in your own way,’ EVERYONE in the Realms ‘believes in’ all the gods, and you as a paladin may encounter priests who expect to be able to command you. Some paladins DO act within strict church 
+_> 6) hierarches, but Player Character paladins are more the ‘operate on their own’ agents. However, if your deity commands you to do something (like obey or work with a mortal priest) and you don’t, you shouldn’t

Among elves there is indeed an equivalent phrase. It’s “Trees grow, no?” or “And trees grow, no?” (Among dwarves, it's "And foes fall when you hit them.") Humans who adventure with individuals of either race tend to pick up these phrases and use them.

?_> Dear [@] Cormyr as of 1491 DR, are there any noble families you would consider “local” to Waymoot in the same way the Wyvernspurs or Cormaerils are to Immersea?
If not, might there be extinct families that were? Perhaps of Esparin stock?
Thank you Ed!

Hi! Sure, local-to-Waymoot noble families in 1491 DR are two: House Irlingstar and House Orthwood. The extinct local noble families, from the time of Esparin, are three: House Huntwood, House Olarynd, and House Zemair.
Realmslore [:]

The Irlingstars are stylish, sophisticated fashion-plates and dilettantes who indulge in many hobbies (collecting exotic monsters as pets, for example). They are scattered all over Cormyr, Sembia, Westgate, Berdusk, Iriaebor

Except this: there is almost no Zotha lore, published in our real world or known in Toril today.
Right, here we go. .some priesthoods, elder dragons, and sages believe that Zotha was a huge, flying being that in outward form

There were other Creator entities in existence in the vast Void, including Asgorath, who also created life and non-living things, and all of them tended to believe they held dominion 
+_> 6) over what they themselves had created.
But Zotha considered that all creations were for it to toy with, alter, and ultimately devour. Including Asgorath’s creation, Toril—but when Zotha sought to devour Toril, Asgorath

I stress again that all of this is disputed and secondhand; no

?_> [@] couple of complex questions. I’ll split them up to keep Twitter from going mad. th•
How diverse are the elven cultures from one another?
I get the impression that Wild, Dark, and Sea are all pretty unique. Moon & Sun are their own joint thing with the sun being/ 
?_> Pretty obnoxiously snotty.
But within this. Is there a sociological difference between a Wild Elf from the Moonshaes vs . . Elvencourt, say?
And to what extent do elves try to retain a distinctive cultural identity when living among other races? For example is a Cormyrian/ 
?_> Moon Elf family who doesn’t reclusively keep to the deep forests going to be more “humany” than a Moon family from Evereska? 
+_> 1)
Like humans, elves (and dwarves) seem to have an innate pride/stubbornness that the more flexible (hence, blend in) halflings and gnomes have less of. This will cause elves to try to retain a distinct cultural identity in
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) direct proportion to how threatened/unaccepted/badly treated they feel. They will blend in more with humans who accept them, and stay aloof and proudly ‘elven’ more with humans who treat them like non-humans. 
+_> 3)
Moon elves are generally ‘welcomed but exotic’ in Cormyr; i.e. most human Cormyreans will respond to their grace and beauty with smiles and either shyness or friendly converse and aid, so the elves will relax and respond in 
+_> 4) kind. If specific moon elves and humans interacting with each other are in close-to-nature settings, they will be more alike because dealing with an environment familiar to both and ‘welcoming’ to both. In an urban setting 
+_> 5) where humans are dominant (e.g. Suzail, Marsember, and Arabel) the moon elves will over time become more ‘humany’ to blend in—unless, on an individual level, they feel more threatened/unwelcome; they will respond to such 
+_> 6) treatment by leaving the setting or being more defiantly ‘elf-like’ (music, dancing, flamboyant dress, filling their personal dwelling-places with not just living plants, but soil and a full-range forest-like growing

It's no conundrum. Some D&D players seem to find it very difficult to move from monotheistic thinking (there is only one true God) to pantheistic (as all sentients in the Realms believe = there are many gods, all are real, and all should be venerated/respected).

There’s nothing to forgive! Ask all you like. Some answers will take longer, though, or even be blocked by the dreaded NDAs.
If a mortal doesn’t worship a specific deity in life, they are not Faithless. The Realms is

However, demons steal souls from the Wall, dissolving the mold by

If a demon steals a soul from the Wall that any deity is interested in, for any reason, that deity may send servitor beings to battle the

Faithless. These are the souls of mortals who deliberately betrayed deities after making a commitment to those deities. The False are punished for all eternity (which sometimes means forever, but in very rare cases means

Heh. No. If the dragon reached the verge of succeeding in accessing such magics, Mystra would "bend the Weave around" said wyrm, effectively cutting him off from ALL magic. Either destroying him due to what he's become, or letting him receive just the trickle

Is this right?

Yes. The current dragon language is called "Draconic" by almost all non-dragons and quite a few dragons, too. When speaking IN Draconic, the language itself is called "Glav" which is the word for "speech/converse" (pronounced like "Glad" with the "d" replaced

+_> [@] 1)
Hi! Yes, he shopped and walked the streets like a commoner whenever not on bodyguard duty. He was well liked, as a quiet, friendly, fair, and gentle man (yes, he liked to play with children, and "boost" them in one palm to sit up high and see the world from there). 
+_> [@] 2)
And yes, he'd be welcome in a tavern (especially by the tavernmasters [barkeepers], because he could and would restore order if brawls were occurring, or quell one from happening. He was a "gentle giant" but NOT dim-witted; he noticed small swift movements  
+_> [@] 3) without seeming to look for them or spot them, so could conduct himself superbly in a coming-from-all-sides fight. Being able to lift and throw tables effortlessly, and chairs with occupants in them, helps too

?_> . [@] Regarding the Company of the Windgorgon, which perished in Undermountain in the 1350s what is a windgorgon, in the Realms? 
+_> 1)
A windgorgon is a very rare (because it was so aggressive that most were swiftly slain after coming into contact with humans), larger cousin of the gorgon that has a acid-cloud breath weapon that jets with force enough to be about equal to a Thunderwave spell.
Realsmlore [:] 
+_> 2) (So it doesn't petrify foes.) Windgorgons are as smart as humans, capable of speech (and mimicry), cunning in battle and defense (setting traps around their wilderland lairs), and are mostly seen in heraldry (rampant and breathing), these days, not in the flesh.

Thu Mar 15 05:22:45 (Realmslore, Toril)

?_> [@] I gotta ask Mr. Greenwood. I'm playing a Redemption Paladin on a Dungeon of the Mad Mage stream. How does Mystra feel about people trying to be better people than they were before, and would she reach out to those that try? 
+_> 1)
Mystra is interested, first and foremost, in more use of magic (by more beings of Toril, not more spellhurling by a few). But if sentient beings seek to better themselves as people, they inevitably are more considerate and understanding of others, and less 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) inclined to use magic to coerce or slay others, or less inclined to try to force those who do use magic to do their bidding. And the more beings who aren't been killed or constrained, couple with the spreading of magic by her own Chosen, means more magic use. 
+_> 3)
So it follows that Mystra is firmly in favour of people seeking to improve themselves, and she will reach out and aid them in doing so. Including putting magic within their grasp time and again, to encourage them to use it. (If they use it primarily against  
+_> 4) others, her aid will end. Mystra wants magic used to create, enrich lives, and enhance, so fear of it will fade and eagerness to harness it will grow, more than she wants it used as a weapon.)
So, yes. If X is trying to become a better person, Mystra will help.

Thanks

Like all Sword Coast cities, Neverwinter accepts the metal coinage of everywhere else, though “foreign” coins (i.e. from the Vilhon and places east and south of there) tend to be valued for their metal value (i.e. “Well, it’s

+_> 5) (so a glint or shield from Silverymoon or a nib or dragon of Waterdeep are called those same names in Neverwinter), but the Neverran/Neverwinteran names for coins are thus: a copper is a ‘tharn;’ a silver is a ‘bult;’ an

?_> [@] hey, Sage, for my Session tomorrow I would like to set up a situation(maybe a trial for a criminal) where my paladin player has to Make a call and decide between Tyr and Torm for their Oath of The Ancients. How could I make it cool and meaningful in-canon? 
+_> 1)
Have a battle-scarred angel visit the paladin and challenge him to answer, on the spot, “What would you do?” when confronted by a law that is being misused, or has overly harsh consequences because of its wording.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
E.g. the law that some Dragonreach cities had (Mulmaster still has it on the books) that an orc who tries to live in the city, or stay there overnight, must be forcibly put outside the gates—and if they persist, put to death 
+_> 3) on the spot.
What if a bewildered orc babe is found, alone, with no parents to be found anywhere in the city? But it clings to humans and weeps, and when put outside the gates crawls hurriedly back in again? Should it be put 
+_> 4) to death on the spot?
If the character chooses “no,” then the character should declare for Tyr, who punishes all wrong (and taking the Oath of the Ancients does mean the character is putting themself in the roles of judge 
+_> 5) jury, and executioner.
If the character chooses “yes,” then they are for Torm, who cleaves to duty and loyalty and would uphold the law. They might petition that the law be altered, but until it is, it must be followed. 
+_> 6)
Make the choice clear by having the angel ask, “Is it YES. .” (and Torm manifests, as a floating, glowing-with-a-white-halo white gauntlet) “. .or NO?” (and Tyr manifests, as balanced scales resting atop a head-upright warhammer).

And there are Lorelords of the Realms, like George Krashos and Eric L. Boyd, who often step in to help me keep things straight, and to iron out the contradictions introduced into Realmslore by others.

Follow-up question: do typical deities stick with humanoids of the Material Plane exclusively for their Clerics, or have they sometimes picked any “outsiders”? I’m assuming besides Aberration creatures and their gods, cuz that’s a huge can of worms to open, I’m sure. Deities sometimes select outsiders as clerics, but in the main, clerics seem to work best (in the divine view) when they're of the same species as the worshippers they're representing the deity to. If the observed behaviour of the last few centuries in the Realms can be trusted.

Fri Nov 02 22:26:34 (Realmslore, Silver Marches, Silverymoon)

?_> [@] question time.
In the 3e sourcebook "Silver Marches", the tearout map for Silverymoon has 826 structures, not including those of the wall, but including that one island.
The populaton, on pg 54, is listed at 37,073. That's about 45 people per structure. 
?_> Some of those structures are only about 12 feet square. The grand houses appear to only be around 500 square feet, ~18x28.
The whole city is about 1750 feet long.
I know, in earlier times, people made do with smaller homes, but this seems quite small.
Am I missing something? 
?_> To add to that. Blocking out the map in 250 foot square blocks, I come up with an area of about 41 acres, which puts it at about 1/10th the population density of Kowloon Walled City, which benefited from what we'd call mid-rises today.
I'm seeing about 12 floors for Kowloon. 
+_> 1)
Yes, in this case, you are missing something.
Have you ever seen Portmeirion (the coastal village in North Wales)? [It's the setting for THE PRISONER classic tv series.] see: "[:]" Notice how some dwellings are literally built on top of each 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) other, with all of them dug into a beautiful, treed landscape? I drew quite a few "street views" of Silverymoon that unfortunately never saw print, but there is a single pic of it in the 3e baseline FRCS "big beige book" that hints at this multilevel, "dug in

+_> 5)
Most of those 12-foot-square buildings are akin to glassed-in gazebos, and are the skylights/air intakes and exhalers of much larger structures buried beneath them. Like the EL district of Chicago or certain "down below" dwellings in London (UK), there are

A few sessions in, I started getting visiting observers: library higherups, concerned local clergy, and concerned parents. The clergy and the librarians had the brains to sit silent and watch and listen, and as a result one of the

Oh, dear. Maybe your life, but the rest of us get to “win” tiny little passing things, at best. We don’t play life for points.

?_> Hey [@] how does one get the title of Lord in the Realms? My players beat those guys in Noanar’s Hold and are turning the ruined keep into a castle. Are they the lords now? 
+_> 1)
Heh. This is one of those "it depends" situations. If they start calling themselves lords, AND live in a castle, most folk they meet will accept the titles. Because Noanar's Hold doesn't happen to be in a ruled realm with a king or other ruler who'll dispute 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) these self-assumed ranks, there'll be no trouble about calling themselves lords. In the common mind (of civilized humans in the Sword Coast), "every lord hath his castle," and vice versa. So, short answer: yes. 
+_> 3)
However, longer answer: if I was DMing this, I'd expect pretenders (armed thugs with a hired adventuring band waving blades on their behalf) to start showing up one a month or so, snarling, "I'M the rightful Lord of Noanar's Hold! Begone or die, miscreants! 
+_> 4)
And in the interests of exhaustive topic coverage: it's really up to the High Heralds. However, barring misuse of heraldry for deceptions, heralds are ALWAYS on the side of more heraldry, so local herald will want more lords, and High Heralds very likely to agree.

?_> Dear [@] hope this tweet finds you healthy and happy
To your knowledge, is their any part of Cormyr in 1491 DR that is popular among Heartlands merchants for its embroidery? 
Thank you very much 
+_> 1)
Hi, Jeremy! I’m hanging in there, and you’re very welcome! Embroidery is something done to make coin by folks huddled in their homes for long hours, especially in cold winters, as root-crop stews and teas simmer on the hearth.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
So, surprisingly to many, it’s the folk who live along the High Road in mountainous westernmost Cormyr who produce the most and best embroidery (and lacework). Mainly the stretch from Skull Crag south, purely because there

?_> [@] Is there a number script for elvish? 
+_> 1)
Hi! Yes, there have been several down the ages. Most popular today: base 10 counting; draw a circle, lines radiating outwards from it are the tens, lines running only into the interior are the ones, and lines crossing from outer to outer right across the circle 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) denote hundreds. These lines are always drawn so that none of them touch (aside from intersecting with the circle itself). [So a capital "Q" to us, is "ten" in this notation. Twelve would be a capital Q with two side by side interior "tails" and so on.]

?_> Hi [@] I’ve heard you love stories about people’s Realms games & sometimes lament a little how many you get are a list of major NPCs killed. So I’d like to tell you about the Cormyrian chartered band, The Silver Unicorns. /1 
?_> First they’re young ladies from Waymoot except the one from Suzail who just spent a lot of time growing up at the family’s summer home there. See it’s a few horse breeders and a high noble lass.
Arwen, a moon elf Needle; Fynaril a half-moon elf Selûnite, Melitheen a human /2

They recently cleared the published Haunted Halls . . so only one floor 🤷‍♀️ but in doing they have formed an alliance with the kobolds living in the ruined keep above to not bother people, to watch for bandits & Zhent in /3

?_> Mielikki (1), Selûne (1), and Lathander (2) and a young eager cleric from the Eveningstar Lathander temple who is all earnestness is staying there to help them learn. We also foiled a Zhent Baneite who was working with a young Illance boy to form a smuggling op /5

Then we, namely Shayna, convinced Azoun IV to give /7 
?_> Then possession of the Halls to restore and consecrate as a temple complex to their 3 gods (and likely other kind/generous gods).
Now that’s all settled and restoration is underway they’re off to the Stonelands armed, metaphorically, with sacks of wine to get the giants /8 
?_> And dragons to work in alliance with the Unicorns and the Cormyrian crown (the Unicorns ran a rough draft of the plan by Azoun and he’s like . . tamed or cleared is the same to him so Barony awaits if it works) but not for the barony but just to make Cormyr a little /9 
?_> Safer and because there’s been hints that the ring of winter is there so they’ll keep an eye out for it. Their main goal right now being really to make a mass slave escape from Zhentil keep and establish a long term underground railroad of Harpers, Elvencourt elves, /10 
?_> Sub-Elvencourt svirfneblin . . etc to undermine the Zhentish power by making it hard for them to keep and trade in their slaves. We reckon they’re gonna wind up on Manshoon’s & Fzoul’s christmas list . . well . . their heada at least.
They’ve just been rescued from /11 
?_> Death-by-trolls by Storm while they were en route to Shadowdale to see if El would be able to help them with any info about the ring which might help them pin it down(rumours of its powers have Shayna thinking in lines of the initial break being on the heels of a magically/12

Also Shayna’s twin sister dabbles in magic. She doesn’t want to be a quicksilver addled, iodine stained person smelling of sulpher & dung so refuses to study anything like powerful magics. Instead she specialises, mostly, in cantrips . . & has

The 2nd Edition boxed set NETHERIL: EMPIRE OF MAGIC (1996) and the 3e sourcebook LOST EMPIRES OF FAERUN (2005) are the best sources, the latter superseding the former.

?_> [@] what can you tell us about Neverwinter’s naval defenses? I don’t believe I’ve ever heard of the city having a navy despite its location on the coast. Thanks! 
+_> 1)
Pre-Spellplague, Neverwinter had a small but very good navy (often replacing ships with bigger and better-armed), hence its victories over Ruathym. The Spellplague and the Sundering destroyed it. Lord Neverember borrowed some of Waterdeep's ships when he needed 
Realmslore [:]

+_> 3) been laid for major warships. Right now, Neverwinter is defended by two secondhand caravel troop ships, four old ex-Waterdhavian (purchased) fast coastal rakers, one of which mainly serves as spare parts for the other three, and one mercenary Ruathym ship  
+_> 4) (the hired 'outlander' naval vessels have been eased out of service, with handsome payoffs and thanks, as the rakers, crewed by citizens of Neverwinter, were eased into service).

?_> [@] [@] Those are it. A lot of bad choices were made during a number of those that made the setting actively hostile for POC through stereotypes, regressive or racist narratives, and so on. It's a thing that happened, and that continues to affect the setting now for lack of being 1/2 
+_> [@] [@] I agree. Oddly, one part of that was having more than one designer on staff who were former history teachers, and so went straight to "hey, we could do this historical thing as a plot driver/big event in the Realms" and so brought in baggage.

+_> [@] [@] from literally all over the world. Some of the local farm families were still hanging on, so I got to see poverty, too, and because it was a wealthy area, there were folks with lifestyles/family relationships different from the societal norms (I was born in the 50s and grew  
+_> [@] [@] up through the 60s and 70s) that had enough money that they could be themselves and not hide and schooling back then was deliberately integrated (I had classmates who were wheelchair-bound and using magnifying glasses, etc. and we were expected to carry them, assist  
+_> [@] [@] ,,,them in class, involve them in sports, etc.) and so it all made for a very diverse mix that was NORMAL for me. (But likely not for small-town Wisconsin in the 1970s and 1980s.) And although racism is certainly everywhere, I'm Canadian rather than American, so the racism "up  
+_> [@] [@] here" was more whites vs. indigenous and English-speaking vs. French-speaking, and changing constantly as I grew up. And I had grandparents who when filling in government forms, did not check off "Caucasian," but ticked "Other" and wrote "Mongrel" in the box

+_> [@] You are correct. See POWER OF FAERUNp29 for a handy comparative ranks table. A modern private = blade in the Purple Dragons; corporal = telsword ("sword"); sergeant = first sword; lieutenant = swordcaptain; captain =lionar; major = ornrion; colonel = constal, etc. 
+_> [@] I think the confusion arises because "swordcaptain" is used as a rank in some town and city watches across the Realms as the title of a street patrol leader so, yes, about an enlisted-sergeant-type rank. But Cormyr=long-established professional military=firm ranks.

?_> [@] Hello from England. Are there any famous/infamous "dungeons" or ruins in Sembia that might be shared? As always, best regards~ GG

Certainly! The most infamous are in northern Sembia, in the forested hunting preserves of wealthy Sembians (many of whom have “country estates” with mansions or hunting lodges, some of which are castles in all but name)
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Most are places where Sembians relax, drink and scheme with other wealthy Sembians, and hunt or fish—but there are quite a few ‘haunted’ and abandoned/ruined sites among them that opportunistic clever monsters, such as 
+_> 3) beholders, illithids, and doppelgangers, took over after their owners died. Sometimes these new dwellers install real or fake undead to ‘haunt’ the upper/outer areas of a ruin, to prevent other humans from taking over such 
+_> 4) properties, then use them as lairs. .or even foment secret societies (of humans, in Sembian cities) to worship them (worship the ‘prime mover’ monsters, that is), using the country estate ruins as gathering places and the 
+_> 5) cultists as defenders (sometimes live-in defenders) to keep would-be new human owners at bay.
The existence of these ‘dungeons’ is overshadowed in public regard by the Ghost Holds in Battledale, but right now northern Sembia 
+_> 6) hosts at least seven: Alond’s Haven, Briarposts, Culark’s Hall, Faereld’s Hold, Landreltowers, Rurethtowers, and Yaeraunt’s Keep. To avoid a massive thread, I’ll tweet descriptions separately, under a SembiaSeven header.

Hi! Happy to help! In all FR Elvish and related tongues, gemstone names have the same singular and plural word form (i.e. “dwaor” means “diamond” AND “diamonds”), and the rest of the sentence gives context (i.e. a numerator; for a few of these, see hereafter)

?_> [@] I also recall the term "a season" being used. While that may imply either a month or four months, this still begets the question of when each of the four seasons occur. 
+_> [@] Water clocks mark whatever time they're set to mark (governed by size of water-holding chambers, and amount of liquid). Twice-a-day city bells were done purely by eyesight (dawn/dusk) or judgment (I'm opening/closing the gates now; ring the bell!) or by time

?_> [@] you don't mind answering, how is real-estate handled in the realms. I'm assuming there may be more than one answer. 
?_> Is every parcel claimed by someone, as it pretty much is here? Are there places you can go into the woods and just stake out a claim? Places where the Crown is involved in every claim? Places where you have to appease two different groups? 
?_> [@] I'm really wondering is if you found a portal to some where in Faerun, how involved would it be to acquire the legal claim to it? Or where there is little law, enough recognition that people don't bother you about your new construction project. 
+_> 1)
The answer is: it depends. On where, precisely, in the Realms you're interested in settling. In cities, every patch of ground is owned, and there is planning control (if only to stop some greedy latecomer building on a street, and "cutting off" those already 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) sited along it). In tightly-governed Realms, there are deeds to land, and control of vacant lands (if "the Crown" is distant, there's a local lord/courtier/bureaucraft administering the royal interests, or local nobles who control lands and rent them out 
+_> 3) sell them, or gift them). But in many, many wilderland areas of the Realms (most of the countryside of the Heartlands or the Sword Coast North, for example), you can just "squat" (settle, build a home, and live there) and no one will bother you. That's pretty  
+_> 4) much how Everlund was first settled. In many cases, all that happens is that, later on, someone comes along to collects taxes, annually. Not demand a deed, or sell you one, or tell you that you can't build another barn or outhouse; they just want the coin.

+_> [@] Heh. Yes, "tela" is little (in a good way), "elnaer" is hero, and "emauri" is false/make-believe/what's desired as opposed to reality and MOST vowel prefixes and suffixes 'go away' when a compound word or phrase is formed and they get run together with other words to do so.

The magical substance known as "smokepowder" (which is not the same thing as real-world "smokeless powder") is indeed what makes fireworks and firecrackers 'pop' in the Realms. Priests of Gond make a lot of money selling "fireseeds," the magically-limited

Sun Jun 17 03:56:20 (Kelemvor, Kossuth, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] I started this account just to ask you a couple questions, (for now.)
First, you said, some months ago, that smokeless powder doesn't work in the Realms..(although it's not explosive technically). Does Kossuth eat the power of internal combustion engines, too? 
+_> 1)
It's not Kossuth who nerfed gunpowder in the Realms, it's Gond. As explained in a Tweet thread May 29th (I can dredge it up if you'd like).
Smokepowder (which is not the same thing as the "smokeless powder" used with firearms here on Earth) does work in the Realms.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Internal combustion engines do work on the Realms as long as your gasoline and oil (lubricant) hold out. Which means 2-strokes, which can run (badly) on fish oil and the like, have a longer life than the computerised, fuel-injected car engines of today. 
+_> 3)
Yes, this is official Realmslore because Gary Gygax and Dave Sutherland and I tag-teamed a charity D&D game set in the Realms once, in which hunters from modern Earth inadvertently took their open "Springbok" runabout motorboat through a gate into the Realms. 
+_> 4)
Kossuth does drink napalm and other flame-boosting substances, yes.
As for someone who doesn't venerate any FR deity dying in the Realms it depends. Sometimes they get "adopted" by a close-to-their-faith FR deity, and more often Kelemvor sends their soul  
+_> 5) home' (through a gate/portal, to their own world). In rare cases, the body gets sent, too the origin of some of the unexplained deaths on Earth, where a body not clad for such surroundings gets found on a glacier, desert mesa, dormant volcanic caldera, etc.

+_> [@] [@] She became Lady Arunsun, but in my original Realms, she and Khelben travel a lot; Khelben gets back to Blackstaff Tower often, but Laeral does not (so they have fond trysts/reunions when she does). The Nine were breaking up in the "home" Realms, which is what Paul

It's increasingly hard to keep everything straight in my head because of the sheer amount of lore, but there's no problem with the recent-time stuff, because the time jump has taken the published Realms about a century ahead of "my" Realms.

?_> Over a year ago, I asked you about some information on the goddess Murdane, and you described her holy symbol. However, when I got back to it, I was struggling a bit with grasping the description, so I tried to design it. [:] [@] 
Realmslore [:] 
?_> Is this visual design how the description is meant to be interpreted?
Additionally, there is no indication of what the Field-of-Gold is shaped like; is there a specific shape? Or is that unimportant?
Your Murdane answer [:] [:] 
+_> [@] 1/2) You've nailed it. In heraldry, the "field" is the background. In this case, the shape of the field would depend on where and how the symbol was depicted. Temple door: entire door gold, black gears upper center. Breast badge on priest's tabard or very large  
+_> [@] 2/2) on a temple wall behind/above an altar: the field would be chevron-shaped, echoing the gear arrangement (so, making a border of gold all around the gears, of the same chevron shape). Sometimes (cufflinks, pendant) an oval, but usually a chevron-shield-shape.

?_> [@] Hi. I have another question. After watching this video multiple times I am wondering if the title for “High Inquisitor” applies to the Clergy leader for each sect of Banites per region, or if Fzoul is the only one with that title. [:] 
+_> 1)
High priests of Bane have regional leaders who are "Inquisitors." Like the real-world Pope, there is supposed to be only one "High Inquisitor," but at times of schism, there may briefly be two or even more rival High Inquisitors.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
And in the 1370s there was briefly a beholder that styled itself "The Anointer Of High Inquisitors" (and proclaimed several, to send against Fzoul; none lasted long).

?_> [@] As ever, your capacity for invention and stirring tales is superb. This is exactly the kind of thing my players will enjoy finding out about. Thank you!

Right, time for an answer to your Question 2 (“How is the worship of Talos treated in Thay?”). Here we go:
Thay has historically had little use for Red Wizards following ANY faith deeply enough to interfere with their obedience
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) to either the Council of Zulkirs, or the Zulkir of ‘their’ school if they’re dedicated to a school of magic, or Szass Tam (depending on when we’re speaking of). Venerating Mystra (or Azuth, or Savras back in the day), is 
+_> 3) readily tolerated because such worship by and large doesn’t infringe on the loyalty of a Red Wizard. Other faiths (Talos included) are accommodated insofar as they don’t challenge the ‘Thay first’ loyalties of a Red Wizard 
+_> 4) (Remember, all sentient, sane mortals in the Realms ‘believe in’ all of the gods and at least lip-service worship them on a propitiate ‘hold-wrath-at-bay’/‘win temporary favour’ basis.)
A Red Wizard who magically called up

I'll tell you about the crossover, then I'll tell you how I was going to use it

?_> In Faerun, he lived on the Star Mounts. [:] 
?_> It seems like a random bit of crossover lore there, just for the sake of it. Nothing came of it, nothing was ever done with Radoc or The One as he called himself . which led me to my story Who else calls himself The One? 
Durnan. 
?_> In Waterdeep and the North, we learn the following about Durnan's early life in the "remote north" [:] 
?_> What if what if . orc raid or was it hobgoblins ? who can remember? What if Radoc saved Durnan long ago? [:]

In the Realms, names are usually sorted alphabetically by first (given) name, because after wars and cataclysms like the Spellplague and Sunderings there were so many orphans. However, inheritance is important, so family names never go away, and in the cases of

?_> [@] Thank you so much Venerable Elminster! So, just to be clear, V component CAN be in elvish, common, dwarvish but also in “unique” tongue (with a bit of taste of Latin and Greek as you said). Can we regard to this one as an “arcane language” per se? Or there can be as many unique 
?_> [@] languages as (possibly) many magicians practicing the Art?
Thanks again. 
+_> [@] There can be as many unique languages as practitioners. And a typical incantation may sound like two or three sentence fragments, all studded with words in many languages, cobbled together, and slang and formal mixed, too. 
+_> [@] So, yes, an incantation can be in Elvish, Dwarvish, Common, Draconic, Giant, or use words from those and other languages, mixed with other words from other languages, mixed with 'power words' (arcane words that to non-learned-in-the-Art sound like nonsense words).

Illuminating as always, Ed. A shame Veldorn has been neglected, as it's such a fascinating location.
Is there some unifying factor that keeps these various monster types in (relative) harmony? Do they share the same alignment or favor the same

They welcome all creatures who ‘play nice’ with others. (I.e. they understand that to every creature, certain other sorts of creatures are food/prey, but they don’t welcome beings who slay, maim, and bully for the delight of

?_> One of my players wanted to open up an orphanage on her land that she got for free. But this thread has basically proven that it would be rather difficult. So we're probably going to think of something else in the mean time. Thanks Ed! :) [:] 
+_> [@] 1)
A pleasure. It would be difficult, but if you find something income-earning for the orphans to do (to pay for food and shelter = the costs of heating the building, nightsoil removal, etc.) it could be done. One thing most guilds don't dislike non-guild workers  
+_> [@] 2) doing is repairing small items by hand. (Because they're too much work for guild members to do, as opposed to large and expensive items like wagons, bells, windows as opposed to individual panes, etc.) In the "home" Realms campaign there's an orphanage that  
+_> [@] 3) collects broken glass and tries to either restore the fractured item if it's of sentimental value to the owner (i.e. it'll be visibly cracked all over, but "together again"), or more often, pulverise the broken glass, re-melt it, and make window panes of it. 
+_> [@] 4)
Please note that most of the difficulties come from guilds and from the "red tape" of a surveyed, crowded city. Orphanages out in the countryside are FAR easier to set up and run (orphans can cut wood for fuel, coppice woodlots for more, grow their own food 
+_> [@] 5) dispose of their own manure, and so on. Guesthouses (simple rentals of secure-locking-door rooms with good beds) are a VERY good use of land in most cities in the Realms, because there's never enough low-cost accommodation.

+_> 1)
It depends. On where the mortal’s heart lies, and on the balance of what they did in life, in terms of worship. The tug of Arvandor would be very strong. (This is why early editions of D&D speak of elves having “spirits

There were active portals between Toril and Abeir during the Time of Dragons?
If there were, there was interaction between the dragon empires of both worlds?

Some say there are still active portals

?_> [@] Hey my good Sage, a question: As per 5e rules for buying an item as a downtime activity, you actually have to roll to see what items appear(better rolls, rarer items) and if a player seeks a specific one they must roll particularly high depending on rarity 
+_> 1)
Any large crossroads trading city in the Realms that attracts a lot of money will be trending towards "super high magic." As the Realms heads into the 1500s DR, I'd put Waterdeep at a +7 bonus in harsh winter height, up to +9 at end of summer when some folk 
Realsmlore [:] 
+_> 2) want to leave and make one last "big sale" to tide them through the winter lean trading times. In the Deep as elsewhere, magic items are held by two sorts of folk: those who have the Art (e.g. wizards) and want to use them/experiment with them/make use of  
+_> 3) them in manufacturing processes [and this sort of folk rarely want to part with them, except in trade for a "better" magic item] and investors. (In the same way that some real-world folks sit on paintings they keep in storage instead of looking at, and own  
+_> 4) houses they don't live in, to eventually resell or auction them for far more than they paid.) It's this second sort of folk that we usually neglect in published game lore, but who are far more "the source" interested adventurers can access. In the Deep, they  
+_> 5) are often nobles (who now need funds), guilds (who are heavily into the investment game, meaning they may acquire magic items having little or nothing to do with what the guild "does" daily), rising wealthy merchants (including the "wannabe nobles" who  
+_> 6) spend splashily), and less often, lower-income families finally parting with a family heirloom (often something dusty, passed down from an adventuring ancestor). Guilds and nobles only resort to "outside" auctions for anonymity; the other sorts usually do so  
+_> 7) security fears. (If nobles or guilds don't care about anonymity, they'll hold the auctions themselves so as to save on the auctioneer's take). Auction or private sale alike, the custom is to hire a Watchful Order member (the Order has a set fee for this, a  
+_> 8) a very reasonable 50 gp) to provide security for the auction/sale and transfer of item (and often involves both spies and "thickneck muscle" bodyguards, a.k.a. "bullyblades" and apprentice wizards, as well as 'the' Order mage). Private sales are usually  
+_> 9) secretive, for security reasons.
And remember: the rules are guidelines/suggestions. When I DM, magic items are never determined by dice rolls; I place what I think best fits the campaign (often 'custom' items), and the hunt and the negotiations are roleplayed.

Sure. Dragons can involve their servants and lair guardians in battles against other dragons, but it’s ‘not done’ to make alliances with non-dragons (such as orc tribes) for the purpose of warring against other dragons.

More than this, dragons shun giants of all sorts. They don’t talk with them directly, they don’t make deals with them, and they certainly don’t make alliances with them or trade with them. Giants are FOES, to be 
+_> 3) bested if one can or is in the mood, and otherwise ignored.
And another taboo: treasure is never to be destroyed or ruined (e.g. breathing fire on gems, but not melting gold coins)

The Chultan Peninsula was sunk during the Spellplague; and is restored to a peninsula after the Second Sundering. What do you think the current state of the Mhair Jungle, Thindol/Tashalar, and Samarch is?

+_> [@] Not likely at all. Elfharrow exists in part because of a shift in rainfall patterns AND some lifedrain magic (leaching groundwater from the land), and it's shrinking as time passes; i.e. Lapaliiya's climate is SLOWLY returning.

Sun May 13 16:31:00 (Cormyr, Eveningstar, Realmslore, Ring of Winter, Shadowdale, Suzail, Vangerdahast)

?_> Time for #SilverUnicorns! Today I’ve a helper! This is probably Meg . . she might be her twin Marcy. I can’t see her ears well enough. Anyway we left off with Shayna in the Stonelands, Arwen in Elven Court, Fynn in Eveningstar High Priesting & I honestly don’t know what Mels is 
?_> Up to. Probably drinking & wenching.
Anyway Shayna is dilpomacing & trying to find out who Findicol or whatever is. She also has an interesting conversation to have soonishly with His Royal Cousinness about those border negotiations 
?_> Met a gonlin leader of one of the Border Raider tribes. He’s a wanker. Allied himself with a red dragon.
This is going to get interesting. 
?_> Oh! IMPORTANT UPDATE! It’s Marcy helping. She’s mischief incarnate & extremely adorable.
She’s awake and says hi. Vx ?;8$(“ (See?!) [:] 
?_> Far less important or [@] detail than a 9.5wk old kitten is that Spring is sprunging in Cormyr, Shayna has had some success at diplomacing the Stonelands and is off to Suzail to visit HRM Cousin Azzy^4 
?_> Vangey is grumbling about not legitimising any non-Cormyrian claims to the Stonelands, bcause Vangey.
Azoun4 digs Shayna’s point that it’s simply fixing the border this side of villages Cormyr alread doesn’t hold on otherwise pointless borderlands anyway. I mean if an orc tribe 
?_> Can reach 1100+ strong . . it’s hardly valid to claim it if you’re not one of said orcs. And if they keep their promises of peace, win. If not . . what’s actually changed?! By this point Shayna is either one of Vangerdahast’s least of best fave people 
?_> Shayna, fwiw, quite likes him. That’s why she enjoys making him go interesting shades of purple. Either his head will literally explode, he’ll have an aneurysm, or he’ll think about lightening up. She can do something to help the middle choice and the 1st is unlikely 
?_> Probably so 🤷‍♀️ it’s all for the good of Cormyr. She’s quite proud of her successes so far, he didn’t – contrary to a betting pool in one inn she stayed in during her weeks in the Stonelands – froth at the mouth! #PROGRESS! 
?_> My assistant, Marcy, had a little Irish breakfast tea (btw, Trader Joes organic IBT . . pure heaven . . rivals Yorkshire Gold . . sorry [@] but it’s true. .ish) and some adventures, time for a well deserved snuggle. [:] 
?_> No, we didn’t give tea to a 9wk old baby. She stole a few licks a d quite enjoyed them. It was decaf. And cats are generally inverse to humans for [@] stims/depressants so likely it’s why she’s sleeping soundly for the 2nd time in a few daya 
?_> Verbally sparring with Vangey is fun.
She teased it’s shocking how little (more than she’d managed to learn, she admits) about Fi Lendicol he knew:
S: “I’m surprised you haven’t had him round for tea”
V: “I haven’t had the pleasure of his acquaintance”
S: “When I meet him I’ll 
?_> Extend your invitation to tea
When done Vangey asked pointedly if that’s all I was doing there. Shayna said she had ever so many questions for him, but lamented knowing not where to start. “In what century DID you get your robes?” And “How DO you get that stick 
?_> Up your arse? Seriously, Lord Wizard, do you EVER lighten up?! I know PALADINS who smile more, *paladins*, Lord Wizard; *HELMITE* paladins”
He was less than amused. She shrewdly pointed out he could just ASK her if she knew anything about someone using powerful ice magics 
?_> In the Stonelands. He was more particular that he wanted to know about rumours she’d ridden an ice dragon to Shadowdale. It was a griffin so Shayna told him he was absurd. She’s scolding him for being so distrusting & conniving all the time as part of why no one trusts him/ 
?_> She pointed out that she is positively convinced that, should she present him his own magically created clone, he wouldn’t trust himself a single inch.
There’s more but leave it for [@] to post the tidbits. Those were MY faves.
But she did tell him to his 
?_> Face that while she doesn’t, personally, *dislike* him she does *not* trust him as his . . Lord High & Mighty I Do For THE GOOD OF THE REALM! routine with the powers at his disposal is, historically, a recipe for disaster. Maybe not, strictly, in CORMYR’S history 
?_> But other realms have fallen to less.
She also points out that, if she had realm stealing power at her disposal a) she has made no effort to take the crown b) why wouldn’t she use to to simplify taking the Stonelands 
She pointed out “Why would I want a crown?! I’ve a number 
?_> Of tiaras already and they’re better looking and far more comfortable
Yes, this IS the woman wearing the Ring of Winter in front of Vangerdahast’s face but she’s not telling him that. She’s leaving that for him to work out for himself to spite his suspicious 
?_> Nature. She’s actually hinted a few times. But, she pointed out to him that one of the first items the Uncorns had found was a blade with WISH & instead of becoming the grand lords of all Faerûn . . they have gods blessed gear & arrows that have a tendency to adjust course 
?_> Slightly. So he can trust that she wants no harm to come to her cousin, to Cormyr, or the Obarskyrs’ rulership.
He argued “yet” which she turned right back on him. I love Vangey, I do. So does she, she’s fond of Azoun & Allusair and is aware of V’s role in their safety 
?_> But she’s more openly fond of Lhaspeera due to her being so much more personable 
?_> So on the way out decided to stop and ask Alaphonder (I’m sure that’s spelled horribly) what he can tell me of the habits of silver dragons. I mean are they like reds who live in caves, or golds who favour comfortably appointed villas (she’s familiar with word that 
?_> A gold lives in Suzail . . obvs, she IS a Suzalian. Hell, for all I know she’s family friends with him!). “High mountain peaks in the clouds or ON clouds”
She boggled at this. She boggles at this while pointing out she hangs with a mage, her twin has the Art, and she’d just 
?_> Left Vangey’s vaunted presence. It was suggested it’s likely the same magics some giants use. She’d, til that moment, assumed that was merely a faerie story item.
She’s back in Eveningstar. The Unicorns are now deciding how best to track down a silver dragon. fin #dnd #cormyr

?_> [@] It’d be interesting to get [@] take on this. I suspect the answer is “yes, kind of—it’s complicated
A lot of real-world analogs we see between the Realms and our world are more projections of our expectations than intentional. That’s part of our designer guidelines.

?_> [@] because of the weird way my mind works this made me wonder: is there precedent elsewhere, in History, Legend, or 1350s DR era of temples dedicated to multiple gods like what my rather holy band has done with their renovations of The Haunted Halls? [:] 
?_> Theirs is *consecrated* to their 3: Lliira, Meilikki, and Selûne, but welcomes almost any travelling clerics who behave themselves; in fact a Lathenderite often babysits the temple for them whilst they’re off on their Other Project. To give context of what I mean abt the temple. 
+_> [@] Yes! The Plinth in Waterdeep was an "all-faiths" temple, well-known far and wide; a shared holy space that was favoured by all of the gods, so there was very little friction between their clergy in using it.
And the Triad's shrines and temples are often shared.

Realmslore [:]

?_> [@] [@] What I'd like to know is why don't sages just keep corpses on ice, embalm or mummify them (not make a magical mummy, just preserve the corpse), then have a cleric cast speak with dead whenever they want to know something that happened during that body's lifetime. 
+_> [@] [@] Because certain undead, and certain cults, will come for the bodies, and most sages aren't fighting types. Word long ago got around of their horrific fates, so they're now afraid to try that.

+_> [@] There's no formal age; it varies from situation to situation, and the individuals involved. In some locales, there are local customs that govern. USUALLY the teenaged years, when the body is changing and the mind racing. (Applies to all races.)

?_> [@] Hi Ed! I’ve got a question that’s been gnawing at me for a while now: when PCs die in your home campaign, do you DM the post-death part — that is, the Fugue Plane and onwards — or just leave things at the character’s this-worldly passing? Thanks a ton, as always! 
+_> [@] It depends on what the player wants to do. Are they willing to 'let the character go' or do they want to follow on, treating mortal life as just one stage of existence? So far, it's usually been the former, but not always

Hi! In the Realms (as opposed to Middle Earth), “Willowcrest” is either Sarrbarand [from “sarr,” plural sarren = willow(s)] or Sarrasharl [“barand” is crest of avian, creature, or heraldic, “sharl” is a geographic ridge

Sure. The exact effects vary both individually and by undead type, but see my 2e spell Nulathoe's Ninemen for the list of minor changes/augmentations. Becoming undead almost always strengthens the LINKAGES between decaying/shrinking/withering body parts.

For example, there are "haunted" tombs in the Realms where strewn/heaped bones 'whirl up into the air' when living creatures intrude, sort themselves into their original skeletons, and attack. The negative energy "holds" the bones together, so the skeletons are

A bloody ettercap is following us. Arwen dispatches the nasty little blighter 
?_> Oh lovely, found the ettercap’s herd! I HATE spiders, these are ginormous. GM may have to find her tea poisoned, moral imperatives and all that
Holy crap! Arwen is SICK of spiders! One-shot kill, another is nearly dead & she’s only one with a turn yet!!! 
?_> Yay! Tower. Why do wizards love towers? Are they overcompensating?? And why couldn’t this guy live IN Silverymoon?! Dude, two words: creature comforts. You’re a WIZARD. How far do you really want to go for reagents?!
Your tower’s gonna try to kill us, I just know it 
?_> I read the GM that last tweet. She’s just said she specifically wants strychnine in her tea. Well . . she giggled a lot. Semantics, really 
?_> Interesting. One of the first things we find is an interesting curio/art gallery from all over creation. There’s a weird worm thing in a box . . creepy
Wine, check
Lavishly appointed sitting rooms? Check
Library! . . WTF?! This wanker kept his MONEY here?! Gold coins . . looking 
?_> For good books we found stupid gold coins! What a rip off!!
We’re gonna sue.
Given the library we’re half expecting to find the good books in his dining room. The wine was in a coat closet. This should have been a clue.

Of course it is. I’m really beginning to suspect there’s not ACTUALLY a Faerûnian word for ‘abandoned’, not with the same meaning as our such wird anyway.

My dude, conjure a MAID!
Bloody hell

?_> [@] Right. I figured it had to be a notable amount fo hair since it was, well, noted.
Speaking of small folk, how did you picture the gnomes of the home Realms? White hair, grey-to-blue eyes, & long wispy beards (as in Greyhawk)? Big long noses? Pointed ears? Human-like proportions? 
+_> [@] I think it was meant to be hair-hue-contrasts-with-skin so NOTICEABLE (like "all over five-o'clock-shadow"). I see gnomes as distinguishable from human children by having SLIGHTLY larger heads, hands, and feet (proportionately). Tend to be fair-haired, but full range of hair  
+_> [@] 2) and eye hues. Can grow beards but most don't as it gets in the way of craftwork/forgework/cooking/carpentry (and they're ALWAYS busy with their hands). Tiny backswept points to ears. Larger facial features than hin, but many can still "blend" among humans at casual glance.

+_> [@] 2) innocents. Class didn't matter (i.e commoner or noble), but he didn't want to exploit anyone poor or desperate. And above all, WILLING (he was most excited when she made the first move, not him), but not in a gold-digging grasping "want to boast I slept with  
+_> [@] 3) the King" way. Azoun's reputation grew in the gossipy retelling, until most of Cormyr assumed Azoun had bedded every woman in the realm he wanted to, and said women were hurling themselves at him daily. Far from the truth. He was a wild youth, yes.

?_> [@] 1) Hey, Ed. Question about the dating of your home Realms campaign (both in-game & reality). I gather the Crazed Venturers campaign began c. 1978, and FR0 and FR1 seems to suggest that was c. 1340 DR. I had guessed the Swords of Eveningstar (KoMD) campaign  
?_> 2) started c. 1981. Your Dragon #65 (Sep. '82) article implies that Doust had recently become Lord of Shadowdale and that Lashan's forces had yet to attack (placing it around the start of 1356 DR). But you mentioned on twitter that Pennae's death occurred during a  
?_> 3) vivid 1979 Realmsplay session. I was under the impression that her death is what spurred the Shadowdale census that occurred in Marpenoth 1355 DR, placing her death just a few months before Lashan's threatening letter arrived.
So either it took a few "real-life" years  
?_> 4) to play out the events of just a few months in-game, or I got some of these dates majorly messed up.
I'm also curious what the year was in your home Realms when you sold it to TSR in the summer of '86. Was it 1357 DR?
I'd appreciate your illumination on this. Thanks! 
+_> Hi! You're correct on all of those dates, including it being 1357 DR in the "home" Realms campaign when TSR bought the Realms.
It did indeed take years of real time to roleplay just a few months in-game. To quote Bill Watterson: "The Days Are Just Packed

I’m a little confused about Jergal. His alignment is NE and he represents the lack of caring that death brings, along with nihilism about life’s purpose. But he’s also the god who records mortals’ times and methods of death, so my question is how he acts upon his 1/2 Alignment, or does he STILL not care enough, even with Kelemvor in charge? I read the knucklebones story, but how have recent events affected his activities? 
+_> [@] The answer to your last question: NDA. The first question: mortals are oft puzzled re. the views, behaviour, and aims of many deities. Gods can be cryptic and can be varied in their deeds and thinking but there's nothing in what Jergal does that is at odds with NE.

The Weave is how arcane magic users describe their way of accessing the raw energies of the world (the "wizard spells" in the Player's Handbook).

There are MANY other ways to access these energies (most of them, except for the divine magic used by clergy, not widely known in society), but if we're talking arcane spells set down in spellbooks, we're talking the Weave.

?_> [@] Wow, you must not have played as frequently as I thought. Also, I can't have been correct in guessing the Swords of Eveningstar campaign began in '81, if Doust was lord by '79. So when did you switch from Crazed Venturers to the Swords? And why the 10-year time jump? 
+_> The style of play in the "home" Realms campaign is full-on acting. Time in-game can move very slowly when PCs are getting to know NPCs, getting entangled in their ongoing intrigues, trying to hold down 'day jobs,' and learning more about the Realms.
In over 40 years
Realmslore [:] 
+_> of real time playing, the Knights have progressed to an average of 9th level, as characters.
That's how my stellar cast of players like to play the game, and as the DM, I am their servant (and like the same style, too).

I read up on Sehanine Moonbow in Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, and there’s a brief reference to the elven phenomenon of having a moonbow in your vision. There was also another reference in Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide to it. Is having them appear in your vision/ Supposed to be physically blinding, or is it more like "worldly things are about to mean a whole lot less to me because I could die any minute"? 
+_> [@] No, it's not physically blinding; you can see through it. And clergy and faithful of Sehanine who see the rainbow can also still see normally.

Narl = black
Oumrae = dark, eerie
Imbur = dusk, sooty, shadowed
And a rose is a “thornflower,” so:
Spir = thorn, spike [pronounced “spear”]

+_> [@] It's based on ability/merit, these days. It has to be. The dwarves came so close to extinction (and know it) that they can't afford bad results. Some Delzoun use "Lord" and "Lady" as honorifics for clan elders, but not titles (aside from military ranks).

Also while I may be mistaken; I am of the understanding that before the company was sold to WoC, TSR series were not DnD canon per say, meaning that DnD publishers CHOSE to follow those series as canon, not vice versa, like it seems WoC is doing since they bought it alllll 
+_> [@] [@] [@] That's news to me (and I "was there"). TSR bought the already-existing Realms to be the "home setting" for the 2nd Edition of D&D, and it was understood by staff and freelance designers that everything we did in the Realms was canon for the game, and vice versa.

Sun Jun 10 03:19:47 (Cormyr)

?_> The #SilverUnicorns are BACK!
A bit late in the day. [@] notion of “just a little bit” was sufficient for me to take a 2 hour nap, eat some crisps, and drink a can of Dr Polar (caffeine is helping reduce my groggies)
We be hunting for the great and powerdul Oz . . no /1 
?_> Wait . . Fi Lindicol or whatever this blighter’s name is.
He’s, for the record, a Silver Dragon what lives in the Stonelands regionals of the kingdom of Cormyr!
Anyway . . bloke sounds powerful. We wanna invite him to tea, maybe bat eyelashes and ask pretty please help tame area /2 
?_> Shayna did a thing and the die landed on 20 AND she has teh +7 so someone has kindly given us Fi’s home address, phone number, email, c-mail, FidoNet, mother’s maiden name, SSN of he and his 8 closest relatives, favourite taco cart, blood type, and bedtime . . before we even /3 
?_> Asked any questions! (Some of that is potentially exaggerated)
Meg is assistant DM 
They’ve discovered they’re fairly close to Fi’s home peak and Ag Drags cribs can only be visited flying. Cuts down on Jehovah’s Witnesses. We flying . . to a Wizard tower?!? Wtf?! [:] 
?_> Dragon houses don’t tend to have a bell pull 🔔, and Fynn reckons it’s rude to start down the stairs uninvited. So we’ve sent a little bird to tell him “Knock know. Hello Mr Dragon, have you heard the good news
Just kidding just a hello, we would like to come in please/5 
?_> It’s freaking cold 🥶 up here as we’re high on a mountain 🏔 peak in early spring.
Assistant GM, Meg, has rolled poorly on a Save vs Nap 
?_> Oh . . apparently it IS the great and powerful Oz. He’s doing a booming voice melodrama thing.
Arwen even said “That was melodramatic
Dragons 🐉 . . go fig
He sent a DWARF . . up a tower’s worth of stairs?! Fi is such an arse! 
?_> Dwarf answering the ceiling is all “you’re rhe adventuring band the silver unicorns”
And shayna is “no someone’s ordered three large pepperoni with extra cheese
At least he was amused. Sad thing is I know [@] has said what the realms equivalent is but I’ve forgot 
?_> Apparently Ag Dragons like overlarge chimneys for front doors.
At the bottom is a very lovely house with a couple humans.
I reckon one of then is Fi, the wonderful wizard of melodrama. The warrior is probably the other travelling companion I’ve been hearing about . . Tin Woodsman/ 
?_> GM just said the warrior IS a ranger. If this dude’s armour has any metal on or carries and axe he is forever Tin Woodsman.
Dunno what to call Dwarfikins. Maybe just Dwarfikins if he’s wont to wearing blue. Maybe Nome King ? i lost count 
?_> That was 10?! Okay so this is 11
Fi is making small talk. I hate small talk. Shayna is probably doing okay at it but I’m about to scream 
?_> So we’re chatting with Fi. There’s this red draggy, 1k old & a total bitch. So I’m going to go have a chat with her. Just brushing up on dragon etiquette to make sure invitation to brunch doesn’t put the inviter into the invitee’s quiche 
?_> So . . brunch with a sadistic red who likes to use charm magics, considers Folk to be Tasty Appetisers, and wants to be empress of the Stonelands seems like a Bad Plan. I may do it anyway just to see how it goes. But she’s apparently on magic skillz equivalent of steroids 
?_> So this is a challenge. Wonder if can loan ring of winter to our silver dragon buddy who’s only a few centuries younger than red
There’s got to be a nonlethal solution.
A non violent one would 
?_> Be nice, but let’s be realistic. She’s a psycho evil dragon who remembers when Thauglor yet lived. If not even the elvish stewardship of Cormyr
This is going to take all the subtlety of a MIRV 
?_> So . . chatting with Fi we decided that a very important goal is to find where Grim lives.
So I *am* going to invite her to lunch, with some bribery, and while she’s investigating the bribe for magics they’ll be safely tucked away inside the messenger . . who’ll  
?_> Be told where to go by a goblin, and will itself be a magical construct with a glyph formed inside it that Fi can use to scry out the final destination of. Either grim destroys an ice critter and the glyph or she ignores it and the glyph dissolves when the magic does 
?_> Fi doesn’t actually know this magic.
So we’re going to have a friendly dinner with the twi most powerful war wizards.
Fi also made a comment that makes Shayna curious the High Wizard & king’s endgame with the Stonelands but she’s considering being polite. 
?_> She’s also debating the wisdom of letting someone with a dragon’s ego, even if it IS a good dragon borrow the RoW.
Storm is coming too as a more charming sagely dinner guest than an actual sage is liable to be.
Tune in next time fin dnd #forgottenrealms 
?_> [@] Next time will feature your DM going mad as she tries to be Storm, Vangey, Laspeera, and a silver dragon all at the same meal! You know, I had a perfectly nice treasure finding sort of adventure to get you guys hooked into, but you’ve just had to go and get all diplomat-y!

?_> [@] [@] It's because the Ffolk are based heavily on the Welsh. In Welsh, Fs are pronounced as Vs. So David is spelled Dafid. To designate the actual F sound, they used FF. 
+_> [@] [@] Indeed. And in the Realms, pronounced "folk" ("f" sound as in the English word "first," but linger on the f, drawing it out, SLIGHTLY, as if being deliberate). NOT "fuf-fufolk." Unless you're a Waterdhavian noble trying to be condescendingly insulting.

?_> So, if I'm not mistaken, if I want to convert say, 609 copper pieces, to the game money I'm using at the table (thrift store copper&silver&electrum coins + shiny gold&platinum coins from 'zon), I should get 33 coppers and 12 silver shillings. 
?_> The goal of this is to reduce the amount of coin at the table and make it so I can still use physical coins for a large party. 
?_> I have no idea what sort of consequences this has as far as inflation goes or currency debasing or all that jazz. Not really going for realism, but I'm sure some econ 101 stuff I don't know about will rear it's ugly head like a hydra. 
?_> We'll see how it works in actual #TTRPG play
The exchange rate seems sufficiently complex, making for easy possibilities to scrape off the top from local coin exchangers 
?_> Would love to get some feedback from some of the great world builders since I'm sure they've wrestled with this before? [@] [@] [@] [@] sure there's more greats, that's just all I know about to [@] on Twitter so far.) 
?_> [@] benjihad [@] [@] [@] Holy Carolina [@] benjihad you put a bit of thought into that. Currency is an interesting thing. I messed with it quite a bit when I was creating the world of #Aihrde. Led me to a whole lot reading on the subject, where and when coins got started  
?_> [@] benjihad [@] [@] [@] (if I remember right it was the Kingdom of Lydia in Anatolia a lot more than a few weeks ago ha). When we published Gary Gygax's World Builder, Gary was deep into it to. He had abandoned the gold as standard and moved to dollars to better account for inflation 
?_> [@] benjihad [@] [@] [@] it was rather complex. But we eventally condensed it for publication. And I did the same for Aihrde, simplifying it. In reality whoever mints coins has power over the currency, so everyone begins to mint coints (it was a problem in the early US as banks were all  
?_> [@] benjihad [@] [@] [@] making their own money. It got nuts. I think it wasn't actually ended to the Civil War. Same for medieval Europe. In Aihrde there are two coins. The Imperial Gold and The Golden Crown but that is really too simple for such a complex world. :) 
?_> [@] benjihad [@] [@] [@] but what you've done here is pretty interesting. Some players are really going to dig it as they can work around the system and use exchanges to get more for the themselves (I have one player who would love it). But I'm curious what is the overall goal here however? 
?_> [@] TrollLordSteve [@] [@] [@] Thanks for your replies, great stuff! Here's my reasoning, it got buried in my wordy ramble. [:] 
+_> [@] benjihad [@] TrollLordSteve [@] [@] Got it. In the Realms, there are alloy "trade bars" (small cylinders w/blunt-pointed tapered ends) worth 25 gp, used a lot by merchants in daily trade (many wear money-belts or baldrics with leather "holsters" for individual trade bars) to cut down "coins carried" to manageable.

Okay, here’s an answer to Question 1. My reply will be in three parts because of Twitter’s wordcount limits. 
+_> 2)
Haradran Baranthar, the Founding Zulkir of Evocation (1030 DR – 1052 DR), was a coldly ruthless, heavy-set man, bald and a masterful actor (in complete control of his face, voice, and body language at all times), who loved

+_> 4) fashion as “fripperies for the weak-minded and easily distracted,” and took care to shrewdly judge his fellow zulkirs, so as never to be caught by surprise.
He became fabulously rich by manipulating Sembian traders into 
+_> 5) investing in Sembian urban properties and businesses on his behalf, and indulged Talos by working on weather magic to ravage Chessenta repeatedly. “Baeranth” was feared and respected on the Council of Zulkirs, as he 
+_> 6) suffered no fools gladly, could be blunt in his critiques, and revealed by what he did say that he was thinking many steps ahead and watching and judging events all over Toril. He was most interested in building Thay into an 
+_> 7) agriculturally self-sufficient, verdant land where innovation on the part of all inhabitants, of low or high station, would be rewarded—and exploited by the society. He was disgusted by fellow zulkirs who used their magical 
+_> 8) might to tyrannize or in any way needlessly assert authority, believing that such behaviour should be reserved for emergencies when the realm was threatened.
He was destroyed in 1052 when a huge storm he was magically building 
+_> 9) over the Wizards’ Reach, intending to send it across the Inner Sea to Threskel and Chessenta (in part to damage crops and property, to keep those realms “behind” Thay in development and too busy rebuilding to even think of 
+_> 10) challenging the Realm of the Red Wizards), turned on him and tore him apart; he was “scattered in a red mist of blood and innards” by its winds. The storm didn’t get away from him, though that was the fiction put about to 
+_> 11) cover up his murder, but was altered by three of his foes on Council, aiding an ambitious evoker who sought his Council seat: the nasal, weasel-faced Zaeruth Vreel (Zulkir of Evocation 1052 DR – 1058 DR), who was not a

Talassan, but was so conniving and treacherous that he became the first zulkir to be exterminated by the rest of the Council, acting in concert at a Council meeting. They gave Vreel to understand they were about to reward

?_> [@] Wow, you must not have played as frequently as I thought. Also, I can't have been correct in guessing the Swords of Eveningstar campaign began in '81, if Doust was lord by '79. So when did you switch from Crazed Venturers to the Swords? And why the 10-year time jump? 
+_> [@] The Crazed Venturers came first, but overlapped the Swords (briefly, both being played at the same time), with some of the players tiring of endless Undermountain dungeon-crawling and escalating foes, and wanting to start as teenaged PCs, low level. Hence the Swords. 
+_> [@] As for the 10-year jump, there was a helpful little kid NPC that the players loved and wanted to meet again, running different PCs, when he'd become a twenty-year-old with more control of the family business and could be REALLY useful. As a patron, hiring them.
