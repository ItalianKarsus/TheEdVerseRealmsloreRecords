Heh.
Canon.
One historical note re. Chris's column: streets in cities appear, disappear, and get renamed all the time, so changing a street name is realistic; it makes a city feel alive.
If 5-year-old me hadn't been raised by an elderly aunt familiar only with older British [:] 
+_>'2) usage, "Slut Street" would never have been named as such.
To us, nowadays, it's a pejorative with a sexual connotation. Back then, in that place, it was a less polite way of saying "slattern." That is, a dirty person with slovenly habits. Meaning: working poor. 
+_>'3) and no more than that (there were all sorts of names, nasty and otherwise, for prostitutes). What I MEANT was that many of the working drudges of Waterdeep (who cooked and cleaned homes and privies, and did laundry, and carried away garbage, all belonging to  
+_>'4) other folks who'd pay them, lived in small rented upper rooms along Slut Street, and over time the street had acquired a fitting name ("Anathae lives where all the other sluts do, along Slut Street. She's southfront, two floors above Uldro's Smoked Fish"). 
+_>'5)
Interestingly, a woman only three years younger than I am, born in Canada, ONLY knew "slut" with a sexual connotation, so the widespread change in meaning hadn't caught up to my elderly aunt, and therefore me. I should have changed it when turning over the

Waterdeep lore to TSR back in 1986, but was too busy finding all the papers and photocopying them and getting them couriered or mailed and keeping up with specific lore requests, at the time.
Perfect example of a change that should have been made. Not out of

?_>' [@] Given the otherwise "living in harmony with nature" thing of elves, why would they build crypts to inter their dead, instead of something more natural? 
+_>' [@] Wild elves do natural burials. High/silver elves have family crypts (proud, powerful families only) to preserve family remains in the belief that those who come later can benefit from them in ways not yet perfected. So it's a sort of seed bank for future descendants.

?_>' [@] halp! I cannot seem to find an explanation on the origins of the Candlekeep symbol
Can you enlighten this aspiring Avowed? [:] 
+_>'1)
Sure! In real life, the origins are that I drew it on a piece of paper in my father’s den one day in the spring of 1971. (Yes, before D&amp;D existed.)
In the Realms, the eye of Oghma stares at you over a shield (field) displaying
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) a smaller eye of Deneir peering through (the rune known as Omma:) the diamond-shaped opening that denotes Inspiration and Insight (sentients imagining things, seeing the world in a new way in light of what they see, and 
+_>'3) writing it down to pass on to/inspire others).
Below it is the double-ended line of Binding, representing Ogham the Binder AND what he stands for: universal understanding by binding minds together with shared concepts. 
+_>'4)
And beneath that is Authem, the rune for speculation, mystery and pondering mysteries, and the question for knowledge and the pursuance of creations.
Putting Omma and Authem together has always meant both prophecy and trying to 
+_>'5) discern the meanings of prophecies, and libraries and the drive to record and preserve the thoughts and deeds of others, to pass on.
So, before Candlekeep was founded, Omma could be found drawn above Authem on compilations of 
+_>'6)
Alaundo’s prophecies, and chapbooks written by sages about interpretations of those prophecies. The founders of Candlekeep added the eyes and the line of Binding.

Sun Jan 10 22:27:44 (Realmslore, the Realms)

+_>'jeffusano [@] Ed, have an odd question. How and where are coins minted in the FR? Are they made at a single location? Struck? Injected or poured into moulds? 
+_>'1)
This is covered in the ED GREENWOOD PRESENTS ELMINSTER’S FORGOTTEN REALMS sourcebook, p118-123, but the short answers are: coins are “struck” all over the Realms, by the treasuries of kingdoms or city-states, whenever they 
+_>'2) want to issue more coinage (thus who do so too seldom pinch the prosperity of their region and make it less attractive to outside trade, those who do it too often devalue their currency so a gold coin buys less), and are most 
+_>'3) often made by deriving an alloy dominated by copper, silver, gold, or whatever the coin is “supposed to be made of,” heating it to soft state, and striking it with a mallet or hammer and a punch or die of harder (and colder) 
+_>'4) metal that impresses a pattern in the soft hot alloy, then treating the obverse the same way, then (for the highest quality coins) clamping the coin and polishing it with an abrasive (usually a sand-like coarse mix), cleaning 
+_>'5) up the edges and any piercings (many coins have central holes) with a rat-tail file, and so on. (Some edge treatments are done with stamps or a lathe-like foot-treadle wheel, some “brightenings” are done with acidic chemical 
+_>'6) baths that are then hastily washed off, and so on.)
Royal or secular, mints are heavily-guarded places where guards (including spellcasters) keep a close eye on who has the punches/dies at every moment, who’s given access to 
+_>'7) them, and the lives and doings of the workers who make coins (to cut down on blackmail and dishonesty; if the coin-makers are rich and happy, there’s little temptation or opportunities for others to gain a hold and coerce). 
+_>'8)
A few coins have been made with molten metals poured into molds, but the results have been inferior coins if the metals are too pure (e.g. all copper, not an alloy), there’ve been problems with separating coins from molds 
+_>'9) without a lot of oil or animal fat lubricants that often taint the coins and make them less durable/long-lasting, and there’ve been problems with surreptitious wax impressions being made of molds, so molds can be duplicated 
+_>'10) and then counterfeiting can be swift and have big outputs, meaning certain coins aren’t truasted at all, which is a headache across much of the planet. So, molds have so far been unpopular.

Mon Jul 19 05:19:46 (Harper, Realmslore, Szass Tam, Toril, the Weave)

+_>'Slade88green [@] · 14h
Replying to [@] and [@] to twitter so not sure where to ask questions about realms lore [@] . What can you tell us about the ancient black wyrm Ahzalundelarr (of the Wyrmbones)? 
+_>'1)
Heh. This is the place to ask. :}
So here you go; hitherto unrevealed Realmslore:
Ahzalundelarr is the dragon most revered by the Wyrmcults of Kormul, as this ancient black wyrm has long taken a fell and active interest in 
+_>'2) human doings, and the politics of rulers, realms, and factions all across Toril, and they exult in being “the talons of his claws, at work in the world
Far more than most dragons (who tend to be self-interested, and ruled by 
+_>'3) greed and vanity, though this of course a generalization that does a disservice to many individual wyrms), Ahzalundelarr is genuinely interested in the aims of sentient races, and how they can be manipulated.
It’s both 
+_>'4) entertainment to him and his life-work; he has grown to delight in influencing humans in particular, but also other sentient races such as the elves, dwarves, giants, illithids, and beholders (almost any being that presumes 
+_>'5) to rule anywhere who isn’t a dragon), from behind the scenes, so as much as possible they won’t realize they’re being played.
He does this by working through intermediaries, and often employs Wyrmcultists as his tools and 
+_>'6) messengers, though he prefers to keep them as unwitting as possible, feeding them lies about WHY they’re being tasked to do something but making it clear the orders are his, because he wants them to obey with fervor, thanks 
+_>'7) to their worship (they believe he is one of the Old, True Gods who truly rule, and deserve to do so, while louder, more foolish deities like Shar and Cyric and Bane and Mystra misbehave and act as wilfully and recklessly as 
+_>'8) the deluded children that they are).
Interestingly, Ahzalundelarr seems to see Mystra’s aim of putting magic into the hands of nigh every mortal as a desirable one, likely as a way of destroying enough of the orcs and goblins 
+_>'9) that would otherwise soon overwhelm all other races through sheer numbers due to their fecundity, and as a way of making others able to better withstand drow, beholders, illithids, hags, and other aggressive 
+_>'10) magically-accomplished, and ruthless beings.
Ahzalundelarr may be one of the major reasons (with the Harpers as another) why no new vast empires have arisen in recent centuries, and the world has instead trended to being a 
+_>'11) place of more countries that are more evenly balanced, so although warfare is no less prevalent, big conquests are—and those whose ambitions may wreak great havoc across the world (such as Szass Tam) are foiled repeatedly. 
+_>'12)
Ahzalundelarr is so old that his body began to decay centuries ago, but his mind seems unaffected, and he has been working away for even longer at a Weave-manipulating alternative to lichdom. This seems to have succeeded 
+_>'13) insofar as he survives today as a semi-tangible, almost ghostly in appearance (though not in nature; he seems to be phasing, and existing in several planes of existence at once) body of seemingly separate body parts (his 
+_>'14) head here, his tail there, one claw yonder, and so on, without a solid body between). He seems able to absorb Weave-energy (that is: magical discharges, including spells intended to harm him), doesn’t need to breathe or 
+_>'15) sleep or eat, no longer cares about owning anything (so his hoard can be spent on bribes carried by Wyrmcultists, and funds to cover their expenses and to reward them), and likes to absorb magic items after thoroughly 
+_>'16) studying them to learn how they act on the Weave, so he can act in similar ways if he chooses.
Ahzalundelarr is certainly sneaky, and his deeds can be seen as selfish and high-handed, but he doesn’t seem to want to rule 
+_>'17) anywhere, or to destroy or best any individual (except to balance out geopolitics by removing troublesome rulers or magnates), and may aid good-aligned and other groups or individuals if their strivings further what he’s 
+_>'18) interested in achieving.
Elminster has hinted that Ahzalundelarr may on occasion covertly work with some of the Chosen, and it’s possible to interpret some words he spoke to a Magister to mean that either a Chosen, former 
+_>'19)
Chosen, or other servitor of Mystra may have mind-melded or even taken over the mind of Ahzalundelarr, to bring about the dragon’s current world-view and innate personal character.
But who can tell us the truth of this 
+_>'20) beyond Mystra, Azuth, the senior Chosen, and Ahzalundelarr himself?
Ahzalundelarr has on several occasions said things to Wyrmcultists that suggest Ahzalundelarr sees a succession of lives for dragons who “accomplish the 
+_>'21) correct achievements,” and that he may be attempting to do this, and so live many lives, in various guises.
It’s known that Ahzalundelarr has several lofty cavern lairs, high in the Wyrmbones (some of them the former lairs of 
+_>'22) rival dragons he destroyed, long ago), but which one, if any, he favours, and where he spends the majority of his time, isn’t known to anyone. He does visit certain hidden locales close to Kormul to meet with Wyrmcultists 
+_>'23) from time to time, but never appears if a trap has been prepared for him, suggesting he can and does scry from afar, and use spies and his own magical means of prying.
So there you have it. Enjoy!

Sun Aug 01 17:55:10 (Forgotten Realms, Raurin, Realmslore)

+_>'LuGame [@] was wondering, is there any "western film" region within the Forgotten Realms? I was looking for it for a brief campaign. 
+_>'What I'm looking for is a desert region with abandoned mines (crewed by kobolds or goblins, why not) and some frontier town ruled by sheriff like in Sergio Leone's movies. 
+_>'1)
The hamlet of Khundul in Raurin, SW of Solon in the desert of Raurin (not far from the Raurinshield Mountains, so not all that far into the desert) should do. It’s located amid parched rolling foothills, with water still to be 
+_>'2) had in an aquifer, if you dig down forty feet or so. Which, as local legend correctly states, is fed by an underground lake under the Raurinshield Mountains.
That water is why the shallow-dug abandoned copper and iron mines 
+_>'3) all around Khundul, especially abundant to the north, have a resident monster population; mainly jellies, oozes, and sand spiders—and roving goblin hunting bands can eke out a poor living.
The goblins, known as the Raadvurr 
+_>'4) after the title of their chieftan (an office, so many goblins have been Raadvurr, the current one being a fat goblin as big as a very large adult human, named Kahvuld) sometimes mount night raids on Khundul, which is one of 
+_>'5) the few oases in Raurin, and for that reason used to be a stop on the caraven route west out of Solon when gem-caravans still made such journeys (across Raurin and through Midwinter Pass).
Khundul itself is a cluster of about 
+_>'6) seventy dugout homes and warehouses, about twenty still inhabited and a little more than twenty now abandoned and filled with blown-in sand. There are many local tales of buried and forgotten storage jars in the abandoned 
+_>'7) homes that are full of gem cargoes, other goods, and even burials of dead caravan escort riders. According to some of the darker tales, some of these latter are “stalkers” (3e: ju-ju zombies) who now steal out of their jars 
+_>'8) by night to hunt goblins, but leave the Khundese alone except for anyone who disturbs “their” jar.
After a century of subsistence living, Khundul recently experienced an upsurge in trade: hunters and foragers from the town 
+_>'9) discovered gems scattered around ash-buried Solon, presumably hurled into the air during the volcanic eruptions that ravaged it. Khundese traders soon found that the stone giants of Fuirjar were willing to trade slabs of 
+_>'10) polished marble in return for these.
Which meant that the greatest feature of Khundul could be exploited again, as the town finally had something to export that was worth the risk: an ancient magical gate (portal) in one of 
+_>'11) the largest, oldest cavern-warehouses connects with a similar dugout warehouse in the hills just northwest of Zindalankh in Semphar, so marble could be sold to builders there.
Which in turn meant that as Zindalankh prospered, 
+_>'12) so did Khundul, and its small population of hand-to-mouth inhabitants soon grew very busy sledging marble across Raurin, prospecting for gems, and trading in Zindalankh. Several tough-minded individuals among them rose to 
+_>'13) prominence in the town, one of them bestowing upon himself the title of Zaor (equivalent to mayor, but it really means sheriff, as he ran and commanded a local law-and-order band of warriors) before being murdered by a rival. 
+_>'14)
There were several Zaors in swift succession by such rough means, and the current Zaor is a Zindalar (man of Zindalankh), Ulthort Eroun, who is an aging, weathered, cynical corrupt man not entirely devoid of mercy or worldly 
+_>'15) wisdom, and came to Khundul with his adventuring band, an all-female, ruthless half-dozen Zindalar who grew up poor but determined, in the alleys of that city. The band, known as the Eirbuyad (a local name for the shrike 
+_>'16) bird), is now Khundul’s hard-bitten town watch, responsibly for keeping order, fighting goblins and other “invaders,” and collecting the Zaor’s taxes, which are a copper coin for all major transactions, building permits 
+_>'17) and wagon-parking in the town (comes with latrine and water-pump access).
Life in Khundul remains hard for its hundred-some townsfolk, but getting better, and the Zaor is popular for this reason: he spends most of the taxes 
+_>'18) he takes on buying smoked, salted and pickled foods in Zindalankh and importing this to Khundul, selling it at a copper above his cost—so everyone eats better in Khundul, these days, and even have full larders. Locals and 
+_>'19) visitors are exploring the old mines, in hopes of finding fresh veins, but thus far have found more Underdark connections—and more prowling, hungry monsters—than mineral riches. Local legends say there are wizards’ tombs 
+_>'20) in the hills around Khundul, and if one of these is found and breached, riches and old fell magic—and dread monsters and worse curses—could well be unleashed.

It was all canonical—for that lair.

?_>' [@] Can you confirm that the property tax rate in Waterdeep is ~1% of the property price per year? It's .88% in NYC, but 2.5% in the Flemish region of Brussels. 
+_>'1)
Nope. You're applying a flat formula across a city that, like all real-world cities, has grown over the years. Most real-world cities have the same disparities that exist in Waterdeep: taxes vary from place to place within a city, and rates also vary with social 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) class (political clout); i.e. the nobles, AND temples, AND guilds get themselves tax breaks, and wheeler-dealer wealthy individuals broker deals with the Palace (just as in real life): I give you this land for civic purposes if you'll give me a low rate on yon 
+_>'3) property over there. In Waterdeep, the annual realty tax ("property tax") rate tends to be lower than 1 percent of the property price; Waterdeep doesn't have "mill rates," it has set taxes per property that get reviewed by the Palace (and always raised) on  
+_>'4) about a twenty-year cycle. (And the above brokering comes into play to win yourself delays in reassessment.) Waterdeep has always had a "flee south to warmer climes for the winter" problem that it has attempted to soften by keeping realty taxes low (as it has  
+_>'5) other sources of revenue like the gate taxes, docking fees, permit fees, etc.).
You can use a percentage of purchase price rate as a VERY rough guide to estimating probable taxes, but don't make the mistake of thinking the city calculates taxes that way. 
+_>'6)
It's always perilous to apply modern real-world ways of doing things to the Realms. And just a brief glance at real-world cities of any longevity (London, Paris, Rome) will reveal that as years pass, their taxation systems change radically (and are inconsistent). 
+_>'7)
For years, I've worked in public libraries, and run D&amp;D mini-campaigns as library programs. Once I ran for five middle-aged, conservative female librarians who wanted NO bloodshed, no monsters, and no magic.
So I gave them a Waterdeep campaign that was  
+_>'8)
Jane Austen-like "social whirl" on one level (daughters of ambitious guildmasters trying to break into the nobility, or at least become social equals with the weakest, poorest nobles), and on the other: turn Daddy's guild money, not quite keeping pace with his 
+_>'9) ambitions, into large fortunes by shrewd property investments (buy, sell, flip, reno, rent out, etc.), and impress Daddy so much that he lets you behave like a full guild member or more, because you understand finance and social nuance better than he does. 
+_>'10)
They loved it, and as a result, we delved into (and I detailed) the byzantine property valuations, tax system, and tax dodges of Waterdeep.
And I inspired two of them to try becoming real estate magnates in real life. One had a disastrous time, but the other

?_>'Hello [@] sir, I was going to DM a hang cage tree prisoner scenario on the island of Vosos or Thonn's Fist.
Any words of wisdom about the island sir?

Sure. Sparsely inhabited in recent years.
A rocky (exposed bedrock) interior in which many freshwater springs rise, and flow to the sea (so plentiful drinking water on the island, and thick forests along the ravines the springs
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) rush down).
Eels (large and good eating, if you cook off the slime) are plentiful in the brackish mouths of these streams, where they meet the sea.
The kobolds seem to have hastily abandoned Thonn’s Fist, for some unknown

Well, to begin, both groups tell the same joke about each other: “You’re assuming they THINK

Third, there are noble families that bridge both groups, like the Roaringhorns (widespread families found in both Waterdeep and Cormyr), that mitigate against some of the wilder rumours

Fourth, it varies by generation. Younger generations tend to rebel against the views and attitudes of their parents, and if older generations hate or despise “those other nobles,” the

+_>'7)
Sundering were such huge jolts that “what happened before” is increasingly ‘ancient history’ in the minds of most people, even most nobles of these two groups.
However, the TRADITIONAL ‘strongest’ (worst) attitudes, still to 
+_>'8) be found amongst the least-traveled and so, most closed-minded (and usually also haughty and pompous) older nobles, are these:
Nobles of Cormyr think that nobles of Waterdeep are stupendously rich, are crooked, lying 
+_>'9) double-dealers by nature and daily practice, and that they bought their titles and have no more refinement nor good breeding than what they can ape by watching noble characters in older, ‘standard’ plays and bardic

Nobles of Waterdeep think that nobles of Cormyr are dimwitted, reckless, break-their-necks-often while riding their magnificent horses hayseeds who all have large country estates, and are really jumped-up farmers 
+_>'11) who look down their noses at everyone else to try to conceal their inbred insanity and their lack of any education at all. (Though, grudgingly, some Waterdhavian nobles will grant that SOME Cormyrean nobles are 
+_>'12) real nobles,” the exceptions being everyone ennobled because they managed to bed some royal a century back, or save the neck of some other royal two centuries back.)
From these worst attitudes, views soften, particularly 
+_>'13) among the many nobles who have set up trade and moneylending and investment alliances with “those others” and benefitted thereby.
Which all goes to show that nobles are as human as the rest of us.

Sat Feb 27 22:47:57 (Castle Ward, Harper, Laeral, Masked Lord, Mirt, Realmslore, Silverymoon, Vajra Safahr, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian)

?_>' [@] all the Waterdeep sourcebooks briefly detail a warehouse called the "House of Tarmagus," but none of them say anything about who Tarmagus is or what they are doing with the warehouse. Could you please provide some elucidation? 
+_>'1)
Eaerdran Tarmagus (pronounced “AIR-drann TAR-mah-guss”) was a wealthy, rags-to-riches Waterdhavian who as of 1357 DR had seen fifty-eight winters, and enjoyed semi-retirement making the rounds of clubs (he was a fan of tales
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) of adventuring, and good drinkables), the better sort of city eateries, and good taverns. He abhorred “open” gambling, or as he called it, “emptyheaded” games of chance (as opposed to investments), had a small circle of 
+_>'3) trusted friends and a smaller circle of lovers among mature widows and independent, never-married women of his age or older (turn-ons for him included retired adventuresses who had interesting tales of derring-do to tell). 
+_>'4)
He was brown-haired, going white at the temples, clean-shaven, ice-blue-eyed, and quiet and “refined” of speech and manners, without being arrogant or prissy. He dressed in good but conservative clothing, not fashionable garb. 
+_>'5)
Tarmagus began his working career as an “errand and message runner” on the streets, moved on up to helping his parents in their shop assistant careers until he could do such work on his own, and settled into working in 
+_>'6) various small shops (usually selling ironmongery or pottery or furniture or other “household goods,” non-perishable and non-edible) for a variety of owners, for several decades. He was smart and alert, and during this time 
+_>'7) learned much about how the flows of goods from places where things were made (as opposed to food) to Waterdeep for sale “worked
And then came the Big Change for him: in 1328 DR his mother died of winterchill fever, his 
+_>'8) father started drinking heavily and followed her to the grave in 1329 DR, and in Marpenoth of that year, a wealthy aunt he’d never met died of old age/natural causes in Silverymoon and left him (her only living relative) her 
+_>'9) fortune: a big house in Silverymoon and about ninety thousand gp in investments, all in Silverymoon. A city Tarmagus had heard much about but never seen, and he didn’t want to leave Waterdeep. So he cut a deal with a Harper 
+_>'10) he’d befriended to sell Aunt Taraera’s house and holdings, take five percent of it all for the Harpers, and covertly bring him the rest as spendable “mixed old coin
This was duly done, and Tarmagus began his second career: 
+_>'11) as a rental landlord in Waterdeep, at first with a pair of new-roofs-needed “ground floor shop, rental living space floors above” buildings in Castle Ward and Trades Ward that he fixed up. He continued working as a shop 
+_>'12) assistant, patiently raking in money from rents, and using Mirt the Moneylender as a bank. He did a few favors for Mirt and the Harpers that won him their favorable regard, and was able to land a few property purchases with 
+_>'13) loans he might otherwise not have got, to buy other properties, until he’d quietly assembled a modest empire. Which was when, in 1342 DR, a warehouse fire in Dock Ward enabled him to pursue his dream of “doing things right 
+_>'14) for trade shipping and storage, and set him on the road to being really rich. He bought the site of the two older, destroyed warehouses (again, with Mirt’s covert aid) and built a new, large, raised-floor and so, dry 
+_>'15) (nothing in this part of Dock Ward has a cellar unless a dirty seawater mold-growing cesspool is desired), four-floor sturdy stone warehouse fronting on Keel Alley that he dubbed “the House of Tarmagus
At the time, guilds 
+_>'16) and merchant costers and cabals controlled all of the Dock Ward warehouse space, which was rundown (drafty and leaky), none too secure (pilferage was common), and insufficient for the demand, so they could overcharge and not

A secure guard was installed (hired adventurers, of course), and Tarmagus found someone he could trust as a “lockkeeper,” to run the place when he 
+_>'19) was elsewhere or asleep (admitting goods in and out). There were the usual troubles with competitor-sponsored arson attempts and raids, but he weathered them all and handled the worst threat properly: when certain shady 
+_>'20) elements (duergar, working through half-orc independent carters and warehouse loaders) visited him in his bedchamber one night to threaten him, he calmly cut a deal with them, and so retained his life and his warehouse—and 
+_>'21) the underground tavern known as the Keelhauled Dwarf became possible, with a corner of the House of Tarmagus containing the constantly-running pumps necessary to keep the tavern from becoming a watery grave for patrons (and 
+_>'22) of course, an access stair for those pumps that continued on, through a secret panel, down to the tavern itself, providing one of its many exits).
Tarmagus grew older, wisely took his adventurer-guards and his lockkeeper into 
+_>'23) his confidence and made them part of his succession plans, and when he retired into the arms of his various lovers, they took over the running of (and profits from) the warehouse and all of the other city properties owned 
+_>'24) by Tarmagus.
They and their children and successors are still doing so today, and they are now “the House of Tarmagus” collectively. Mirt and several other Masked Lords, as well as Samark Dhanzscul, and now Laeral and 
+_>'25)
Vajra Safahr, have all watched over the House to make sure it doesn’t fall under the control of the Xanathar or any guild or noble family, and so remains a small-merchant alternative available to anyone operating in 
+_>'26)
Waterdeep.
The House has had to build several other warehouses (in Trades Ward and South/Southern Ward) to take overflow business, because the main warehouse has been “near-full” almost since the day it opened. It gets 
+_>'27) re-roofed every twenty years or so (coated metal, duergar-made “shingles”).
Its metal-sheathed doors are emblazoned with the badge of Tarmagus: two disembodied human hands clasping a small closed coffer [miniature hoop-top

The House continues to flourish, after the happy and peaceful death of its founder in 1389 DR, because it continues to be useful

+_>'Jon Gomez [@]  [@] greetings from Colombia!
Sorry to bother you, but perchance do you know which currency is used in the Windrise Ports? 
+_>'1)
Like most cosmopolitan trading ports in the Realms (e.g. Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate), the Windrise Ports use all coinage from mintings everywhere, plus gems and (electrum, as silver was tarnishing too quickly to retain its 
+_>'2) popularity) trade bars for larger amounts.
I mentioned Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate because they (plus Tharsult, Ormpur, and the ports of Calimshan) are the places in Faerûn where someone will most often find coins from 
+_>'3)
Laerakond in circulation.
All of the Windrise Ports mint their own coins from time to time, as necessary rather than “officially,” stamping them with the city’s rune on one side, and the civic motto on the other. 
+_>'4)
They are scrupulously “pure” metal (soft gold is an alloy with silver, but the coin is over nine-tenths gold) and uniform size, and so “hold their value” in distant places.
Values are in keeping with the 1400s DR overall norm: 
+_>'5) a silver is worth ten coppers, an electrum is fifty cp, a gold equals 100 cp, and a platinum is 1,000 cp.
Copper piece: a haeth (slang: “deadeye” or just “eye”)
Silver piece: a talond (“promise”) 
+_>'6)
Electrum piece: a haebur (“eagle”)
Gold piece: a crown (“dragondew” or just “dew”)
Platinum piece: a splendor (“blaze”) 
+_>'7)
All state-minted coins of Laerakond have grooved edges (an indented line running right around the coin), but no rims. All coins are center-pierced, for stringing on a “purse-cord” (which, these days, is usually a wire with a 
+_>'8) strong-spring clasp).
Recent mintings are as follows:
Tarmalune: coins are oval, long axis about twice the “height” of a gold coin of Waterdeep.
Rune: The Haven, a semicircle bumping upwards from three parallel horizontal 
+_>'9) straight lines, the uppermost crossing the entire coin, the middle line being a little shorter, and the bottom line being shorter still.
Motto: “All sailings enrich home: Tarmalune” 
+_>'10)
Harglast: coins are “kite” diamonds (two short sides “upper” sides, two twice-as-long longer “lower” sides).
Rune: The Trune: an equilateral triangle, bottom horizontal, formed by two triangles touching a diamond. 
+_>'11)
Motto: “Prosper Harran”
A Harran is a citizen of Harglast 
+_>'12)
Imdolphyn: coins are circular, diameter the same as the height of a gold coin of Waterdeep
Rune: a vertical line of four identical circles*
Motto: “None Richer” representing an endless fall of coins 
+_>'13)
Ramekho: none (uses coins from everywhere else, and barter) 
+_>'14)
Sambral: coins are circular, diameter the same as the height of a gold coin of Waterdeep
Rune: A drawn sword, cup hilt and thin-bladed like a rapier, running around the coin clockwise (so, blade is a circle 
+_>'15) point on the left touching pommel on the right at the “top” of the coin).
Motto: “Suffer No Slight”

Sat Nov 27 07:55:41 (Eveningstar, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_>'Hi [@] , hope this finds you well on this turkey day. I was hoping to pick your brain. Do you by chance have the complete lyrics to "Ever a Hero Be"? It was a ballad written by Thalloviir Vaundruth in 1344DR, featured in your novel The Swords of Eveningstar. 
+_>'1)
SUCCESS! So, here you go 
Ever a Hero Be
This ballad was penned by Thalloviir Vaundruth, Bard of Beregost, in 1344 DR. It consists of seven verses sharing the same rhyming scheme, and separated by a five-line refrain.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Until now, only the second verse has been seen in published Realmslore, as the header quotation of Chapter 13 of Swords of Eveningstar.
It was Vaundruth’s habit, shared by many traveling minstrels and bards of the time, to begin a performance by announcing the  
+_>'3) name of a ballad, speaking each word slowly and deliberately, with pauses between, thus:
EVER
A
HERO
Be! (Then the performer would strike an strange, complex opening chord, usually not one or even in a key heard in the ballad itself; listen to the  
+_>'4) opening of the Beatles song A Hard Day’s Night for an example of one such. This chord might seem random, but is repeated exactly at the end of the ballad, to signal to listeners unfamiliar with a tune that the song was at an end, not merely reaching a pause.) 
+_>'5)
O hovel rude or castle tall
Empty purse or having it all
We all need heroes lest we fall
For force creeps in through every wall
To dance on bones with glee 
+_>'6) [Refrain:]
Home and hearth and loving arms
Food and friends all have their charms
But to defend and keep them you must evil see
And fight it fierce but thinkingly
To please the gods, and ever a hero be 
+_>'7)
But deep in halls dark and haunted
Even heroes bold, high-vaunted
Twice and thrice, to end up daunted
Think of loved ones deeply wanted
And much safer places to be [Refrain:] 
+_>'8)
Way on seldom straight or bright as thought
For the truth you hear is sometimes not
And firm loyalties they can be bought
Stride once wrong and catch it hot
Die or learn right fast when to flee [Refrain:] 
+_>'9)
Once young and eager, restless, I
Did yearn for gold and feasts to be my
Daily lot as my name soared high
Til I had all the castles I yearned to buy
I think I’d want at least three [Refrain:] 
+_>'10)
Wiser then I grew thanks to the gods
And many a kick square in the cods
Yet slowly won the approving nods
And learned to smell the subtle frauds
Well, enough to stay alive and free [Refrain:] 
+_>'11)
So, now I’m old, no longer bold
My flame it sinks, to soon grow cold
My face no more here to behold
My tale’s end it shall be told
And the gods shall come for me [Refrain:] 
+_>'12)
O, after many flashy things I have yearned
And many of my desires have me spurned
My share of bridges behind me burned
This hard lesson I have learned
But now share with thee for free: [Refrain, but sung loudly and at half speed; the audience knows that  
+_>'13) the custom is that they can join in if they want to, chanting if they can’t carry a tune]
And there you have it. :}
Enjoy, I hope!
Ed 
+_>'Oh, and the tune is pretty close to this: [:] (from the carol See Amid the Winter Snow, but a performance in the Realms would be much closer in sung style to this)

?_>' [@] Whats special about clerics then, and what is the reason to be a cleric instead of wizard?
Are clerics basically inferior at everything version of wizard? 
+_>'1)
Clerics are devout followers of a deity who dedicate their lives to furthering that deity’s aims and desires in the world, and who are given a special status and powers (including divine spells, not to mention in some cases
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) being directly rescued by the deity or a servitor of the deity) as a result of their dedication. That’s the reason to be a cleric.
Wizards must have the Gift (innate ability to master the Art = arcane magic) in order to work 
+_>'3) any magic at all (as opposed to just being a sage of magic). A cleric might have the Gift, too, but choose to worship and serve instead. One’s not inferior to the other, and neither is a “version” of the other.
As I ponder 
+_>'4) your question, I’m guessing (may be wrong) that you’re thinking in D&amp;D game terms of cleric vs. wizard. Sorry, but I very seldom do that (except when designing official products, and so, wearing my game designer hat)

Mintiper was an active NPC in home Realmsplay. Although the PCs rarely saw him, as he was tirelessly traveling (adventuring), he left word (usually tips and warnings) for them with many Harpers and innkeepers across the Sword Coast North, and their paths did

+_>'Ed Greenwood [@] 15, 2018
Tendays in the Realms, not weeks. No official “off days” but temple and local civic festivals (which ARE days off for all) are many, and it’s understood workers need time off, so almost all 
+_>'2) businesses are staffed in shifts to make this possible. (Some guilds require this.) Most [etc.] 
+_>'Jonah [@] for the reply!
I ask because I’m homebrewing some rules about operating a tavern in the new Waterdeep adventure. As a food service employee, I’m just wondering what the on/off day ratio looks like. 
+_>'Because a tenday has 3 more days, is it as simple as 1 more off day? 
+_>'Ed Greenwood [@] dicker with employers (it’s an expected thing) to work more days “on” in a row in order to get more days off in a row (to make a trip, visit family or nurse a family member, for weddings, etc.). 
+_>'Indrasil [@] am running a campaign in FR and in Xanathar’s one of the downtimes says you need X amount of workweeks to gain a language/prof in a tool. What. .is the work week for an instructor? 
Would an teacher be teaching all 
+_>'ten days of a tenday? Or would they have some days off? Or is that more of a case by case basis and the DM should just give an estimate? :30 AM · Oct 28, 2021 
+_>'1)
In the 1490s DR, a typical Waterdhavian worker in a high-stress front-of-house position (a maid or server) with a stellar employer might get a half-day “completely” off every third day—but it would be understood that this 
+_>'2) would be cancelled/postponed for crises (someone displaced so an extra household is unexpectedly housed under your roof), unexpected important guests, or big events. If this happens, the custom (and for guild members, it’s 
+_>'3) a formal, enforced rule, with “won’t work for” blackballs for deliberate rulebreakers) is to later (but always “within the season,” meaning same half of the year) give a full day off in lieu. So if you give up two half-days in 
+_>'4) a row for a festival or the like, you’ll get two full days off later, not necessarily together and usually not at the same time as co-workers (times off are ”staggered” so SOMEONE is on duty).
Instructors are USUALLY, in Waterdeep 
+_>'5) at this time, except when employed on staff by the very wealthy or nobility (like a real-world “governess”), working for themselves. So they can fill every moment if they need/want the pay, or give themselves time off. 
+_>'6)
Again, there will be crises (mustering for a trading expedition, so suddenly a lot of folks need to learn a smattering of a particular unfamiliar-to-them language) that will upset the norm, but a usual situation for a 
+_>'7) working-for-themselves instructor (craft or tutoring) is a quarter-day off every fourth day, or a half-day off every fifth day.
Kitchen staff and stable hands and other “lowly” workers get a lot less time off; they’re usually 
+_>'8) on duty every day, nine out of ten, with a tenth day off to visit family, attend formal services at a temple, or just laze or sleep. However, it’s expected that such workers will get meal breaks and “ale breaks” throughout 
+_>'9) their workday, meaning that if an employer or client find them lounging in a back alley with a mug of something, they’ll be neither angry nor surprised; such time is accepted.

?_>' [@] I find this Table Magic really interesting. Would you mind telling me more about it? Is there a limit to the spells it can cast? 
+_>'1)
To work Table Magic, you need a particular sort of flat, smooth stone surface to be the table (it can be bedrock in the landscape, or a cut slab). You need cones, pillars, and other geometric shapes of specific substances
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) acquired in particular circumstances and then shaped in exacting ways (this is the hardest part; getting some of these can involve dangerous quests/adventures).
You must use natural chalk (or the caster’s own blood) to draw 
+_>'3) the right glyphs in the right places on the table, circling each one and then joining the circles with lines along which words (silent incantations) are written.
When the pattern is complete, a rune of activation is drawn 
+_>'4) the final stroke of which severs one of the lines (of the pattern) drawn earlier.
If any of these preparations has been done wrong, nothing at all happens.
If everything’s been done right, the severing of the line calls on the 
+_>'5)
Weave for energy, which ignites the chalk lines at the severing-point. Then blue flame rushes along all of the written chalk marks (burning with an acrid smell, and very little smoke) and leaping to the shapes of substances 
+_>'6) (e.g. pillar of salt, cone of ebonwood, piece of ivory or an entire dragon or whale tooth) upon reaching the circle around each shape. As this is happening, a spell forms, as a glowing, roiling smoke above the table, and the

+_>'8) unleashed; they direct/hurl/aim the spell from themselves just as a wizard or sorcerer does. Regardless of its success or failure, and regardless of the usual flammability or inflammability of the chalk and the substances

So, one spell per table “setting

In the lands along the north shore of the Lake of Steam, many gases erupt from fissures in the earth, and/or bubble up through pools and even into streams (which sometimes emit “smoke” [hot mists] as a result.

Some of these “fumes and vapours” are toxic, some just smell bad or taint the earth or bring on hallucinations, and some are useful medically or in hide-curing and other processes if captured in vials.
The active vulcanism

The Lake of Steam area can be dangerous to mine in, due to arsenic exposure and noxious or even explosive gases

Wed May 19 04:18:21 (Realmslore, the Realms)

+_>'1)
Snow elves are called “snow elves” by non-elves, “Noroth” (cold-lovers) by other elves, and call themselves “Raetha” (Clear-Bright-Cold).
In the Realms, they’ve never been numerous, in part because of the harsh climate they
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) live in, and in part because of strife with orcs (and even drow) whenever they venture too deeply into the fissures and caverns in the mountains they live on—and in. Raetha long ago mastered ice magic (arcane spells that can 
+_>'3) reshape ice, turn it into water and vice versa, use it as a weapon, and even “lock” other spells into it so that if a spelltrapped area of ice is shattered, the trapped magic is unleashed). It’s by use of ice magic that 
+_>'4)
Raetha fashion castle-cities to guard the entrances to their cavern homes: watchposts, approach-trails (and slides) and fortress walls and platforms. This has given rise to the belief that snow elves live in cities of ice 
+_>'5) but they don’t (because this has proven impractical; to prevent icemelt from sun, magic had to be used to create permanent fogs, to protect elaborate cities, whereas the fortresses they do build are smaller and can be 
+_>'6) protected against sunlight with smaller, more practical spells). Many Raetha abodes are caves that open out of mountainsides, that have permanent window-walls not of glass, but of spellguarded ice.
It’s very rare for Raetha 
+_>'7) to venture down into the warmer rest of the world; they find it intolerably hot and humid, and have little interest in what they see as crowded, chaotic, violent regions. So they have little contact with the wider world 
+_>'8) the few Raetha who do are considered mad by some, but bold adventurers by others, and tend to return (if they survive to return at all) with new items, new substances, and new ideas that the
Raetha study eagerly, and so 
+_>'9) benefit and change.
Largely through uninterrupted study and experimentation, Raetha have achieved superb mastery of magic, and usually defeat the drow they do encounter (one deadly thing they can do in battle is hurl bursts 
+_>'10) of water, and follow them with ice spells that turn the water that’s drenched a foe into clouds of ice spears and daggers that the casters can move, from afar—so they can readily pincushion foes.
Raetha hunt remorhaz for 
+_>'11) sport, accomplishment, and food (the “sport” part of it is that they only use magic when desperately hungry, otherwise taking down the beasts with hand weapons; they take pride in besting such mighty creatures in this 
+_>'12) manner). Most Raetha food is fungi they farm and harvest in their deeper caves, beetles that feed on that fungi that they also harvest and cook, and fruit grown in caverns touched by sunlight, through focal lenses of 
+_>'13) spellshaped ice.
A few Raetha cities wield “sunbeams” as defenses, that they can magically call up, then aim and use to cook enemies approaching from either inner cavern depths, or mountain slopes.

?_>' [@] I have a character, who turns to be a Netherese wizard surviving Ytryn's fall. Who have been cruel, evil and had a hobby collecting (and imprisoning) magical creatures. A cunning Efreetie in his posession lured him into a trap that changed his alighnment 
+_>'1)
Well, here’s the situation: the Netherese, at the height of their empire, were very diverse. As in: High Netherese and Low Netherese were such separate classes that they were really separate CULTURES, after a few generations
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
AND most Netherese flying cities were ruled by strong-willed individuals with their own ideas about things, so they differed widely from each other.
So names from back then have a WIDE variety, though they do follow a 
+_>'3) given name, middle names, family name” format. And most Netherese, High and Low, tended to have several middle names, because that’s how family names were preserved, when marriages happened: the higher-status family name 
+_>'4) became the retained surname, and the lower-status family name became a middle name. (Yes, there were often disputes, and individuals switching surnames as they got older and preferred one side of their heritage over another. 
+_>'5)
In the case of two prominent families intermarrying, the newlyweds often retained the family name they came in with, and their offspring bore a completely-new, invented-by-the-parents, family name.) Most names “meant 
+_>'6) nothing, except when commemmorating a fondly-remembered hero who bore the same name in the past.
So if your character came from Ythryn, popular male given names back when it was flying freely about included Aytharr, Cabatel 
+_>'7)
Duthiir, Ferendr, Gauntaun,* Haenth, Klevven, Rivrel, Sarmasklur, Tolruevren (“Tol” in daily usage)*, Waezrel, Woen,* and Yavron.
If he calls himself “Ali” as an echo of his given name, then he was probably named one of the 
+_>'8) rarer given names, Allivrar or Alvrays.
A note: unless he was a wizard of the Ebon Star, his name would NOT have ended in “-thas.” Or else!
Another note: all of the names above marked with asterisks can be borne by any gender. 
+_>'9)
And the leading families of Ythryn (beneath the ruling Ebon Star wizards) included the houses of Balant, Clarrvees (Balant and Clarrvees had an ongoing, bitter feud), Harast, Jaerel, Mratchlan, Orivvon, Perindel, Roaresk  
+_>'10) (warriors often employed by individual Ebon Star arcanists as “dirty tricks” agents and to go on “gathering” expeditions on the surface and subterranean Realms of the time), Sorsoun (artificers who grew rich making tools and 
+_>'11) tech), and Tammaranter.
The most popular Ythrynna female given names included Aerae, Cadelys, Deirym, Eluphra, Faurauntra, Gothynd, Hraeda, Joszynd, Lhaerae, Mnarra, Olope, Paera, Qelzelma, Rueva, Sazarra, Tyndraele, and Zue

?_>'Hi [@] and happy friday! Quick Q 4 U. The Jotunslayers from spellfire card game. Is there any lore about that apart fro, them being dwarves? the card is branded with FR logo. dnd #dungeonsanddragons #ForgottenRealms 
+_>'1)
The Jotunslayers are an all-dwarf adventuring band who love to fight monsters; they LIKE battle-fray. And hard drinking, and telling tales in taverns of their battles, and devising new tactics for battling monsters.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
They’ll fight orcs and hostile humans if they must, but thirst to fight dragons and tentacled things and strange beasties of all sorts. Main weapons: axes and enthusiasm, but they all carry bags of tricks, from marbles and 
+_>'3) caltrops for underfoot to acid-filled grenades and tripwires with viscid-glob end-anchor blobs, in pouches and scabbards and the like strapped to them (baldrics over leather armor, jerkins of many pockets, tools and weapons 
+_>'4) on thongs so they won’t be lost when dangling because something else had to be hastily grabbed instead).
The Jotunslayers are adventurers-for-hire, much in demand for “cleanse out the menaces in this area” and escort through 
+_>'5) wilderlands work. They typically refuse “guard my doors” and urban bodyguard duties (“Not what we do”) and are far too busy on the surface for much Underdark work; nobles, guilds, and wealthy merchants enthusiastically hire 
+_>'6) them for “make my cargo/territory/family member being shuttled from A to B, all safer” assignments.
Their name came from early days of scouring out many hill giants and surface-raiding fomorians; they have no special hatred 
+_>'7) for giants, nor feuds with them.
The Jotunslayers are typically about a score strong, with about six of those being novice members on probation/training to replace dead or recuperating wounded stalwart members (often these 
+_>'8) novices are younger kin of members). They are a motley of dwarves either outcast or wandering, from many clans, but were formed in Everlund in 1346 DR, by a core of four female dwarf fighters and two male dwarf clerics of

Marthammor Duin. Only two of those founders survive today, and they lead the Jotunslayers: the CG df 14th level fighter Shandrannon Ironshield, and the NG dm 12th level cleric of Marthammor Duin Bruckhlar “Buckhard” Deepdelve.

Wed May 05 01:08:59 (1492 DR, Baldur's Gate, Forgotten Realms, Realmslore, the Realms)

+_>'Fernando DM [@] Master [@] could you tell us about the Bank (financial entity) that operates in Baldur's Gate? My Campaign works in this city and I need a little of your knowledge! Thank you and big hug! 
+_>'1)
Banking in the Gate, as in most cities in the Realms, is primarily done by three groups of people: temples, moneylenders (wealthy private individuals), and guilds. There are also rollcoins and manycoins businesses (see the 
+_>'2)
Money Matters” chapter of the “Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster’s Forgotten Realms” sourcebook). In addition to these groups, the larger shipping fleets and trading costers (overland trading companies) have always functioned 
+_>'3) as banks for some of their clients (often as a way to “tie” those clients exclusively to them).
Dissatisfaction with such practises, and with the increasingly shady tactics of some moneylenders (who, with all the local 
+_>'4) competition, have had to cater to increasingly desperate/financially unstable/long-odds-mercantile-gambles clientele), led to the establishment of the Counting House.
Located on the waterfront of The Steeps, overlooking 
+_>'5)
Gray Harbor, and run in 1492 DR by the rather sinister (and aloof, guarding his words carefully and spending much of his time looking calmly expressionless; his beard has two dark streaks down either side of his—hidden by 
+_>'6) it—chin) LE gold dwarf Rakkath Glitterbeard. Who is publicly the treasurer for both the city-sponsored Council’s Eminent Fellowship of Financiers and the Honorable Order of Moneylenders—and far less officially, Kingpin of 
+_>'7) the Steeps in the criminal organization known as “the Guild”—which means he governs and settles disputes among the less forgiving lonesharks and the “enforcers” they employ, following a policy of “dire warnings are fine, but 
+_>'8) a dead deadbeat can’t be squeezed; leave them alive—just—as a more effective dire warning
The Counting House is the center of official trade and business in the Gate, offering banking safe storage (vault) services 
+_>'9) currency exchanging for bulk amounts no independent moneylender could easily manage as well as small transactions, and investment (in Gate cargoes, businesses, real estate, warehousing rental space, and both land and naval 
+_>'10) shipping) banking services. It’s open dawn to dusk, and is famous for its polite, unflappable staff.
The Counting House is built like a fortress, with thick stone walls and windowless upper floors. Belowground, it descends 
+_>'11) for many levels in a cylinder of thick stone guarded by water-warding spells (against coastal flooding) and some secret devices and guardians surrounding that cylinder, and within the cylinder and very much menacingly 
+_>'12) visible, stone golem sentries that patrol the deepest levels in such a manner that two are always within sight of each other.
These deepest levels store the wealth of many Baldurian families—not to mention many treasures 
+_>'13) stolen by the Guild, and quietly placed there by Glitterbeard.
Local rumor in the Gate says that the regalia of several fallen thrones are among the contents of the Counting House vaults.

Mon Apr 12 00:03:36 (Realmslore, Uthgardt, adamantine)

?_>' [@] I can't begin to tell you how much I love your work.
I'm drafting a side quest for my players &amp; looking for a for a new mine for Mirabar (perhaps a new type of ore?) &amp; stumbled upon Ravens Rock. Is there anything interesting you can tell me about the Uthgardt site? 
+_>'1)
Well met!
I hope these words will be useful
Out of a narrow cleft in a frowning wall of peaks not far from the seacoast, and well west of Mirabar, part way along the southern face of the Spine of the World range, plunges the
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) icy-cold Black Raven River. If you win past that torrent into the higher space beyond, you’ll find the cleft forks around a high plateau, with a small, intermittent meltwater stream descending the narrower western cleft, and 
+_>'3) the Black Raven River thundering down the broader cleft. The western cleft can readily be ascended (and the eastern cleft climbed with more difficulty, farther north) to reach the top of that plateau.
Where you’ll find Raven 
+_>'4)
Rock, a hundred-foot-tall black rock that resembles a lifelike statue of a perched black raven, its beak overhanging a wolf-shaped depression in the ground.
There’s some debate among sages about how much sentient hands have 
+_>'5) shaped the stone raven, and how much it’s natural (or the work of the gods), and the top of the plateau is a mixture of odd-looking nature and human (Uthgardt or perhaps even older) tampering.
The top of the plateau has four 
+_>'6) higher, smaller plateaus atop it. Three of them are to the sides and rear of the plateau, and are topped by standing stones (menhirs). The fourth has two steps (a smaller plateau above a larger, that rises from the main 
+_>'7) plateau all of these features stand on), and the stone raven stands on this highest, smallest plateau.
The local microclimate is cold, and direct sun rarely reaches any part of this cleft in the Spine for long, so all of this 
+_>'8) area is customarily covered by snow, and there are frequent snowfalls, particularly in spring and fall, but very few howling storms, as the surrounding peaks break most winds, and the only prevalent breeze is along the river 
+_>'9) (past and below the plateau).
In the heart of the depression in front of the stone raven stands a stone altar: a huge hump of bedrock, not a stone block. It’s engraved, around its sloping sides, with the phases of the moon 
+_>'10) and its top is flat, with a very slight oval depression large enough for six adult humans to lie down in, side by side and touching, and about as deep as the thickness of a large, burly human body.
All of the Uthgardt tribes 
+_>'11) have ancestral mounds, sacred to them, where they bury their most revered tribal dead, and to which they return to speak with their ancestors and to make important tribal decisions “under the regard of” their ancestors. 
+_>'12)
Raven Rock is (uneasily) shared by two tribes: the Black Raven tribe and the Gray Wolf tribe. The Black Ravens guard those two smaller, higher “step” plateaus, and let no non-Black Ravens set foot on them, nor touch the stone 
+_>'13) raven (even with something flung or shot, like an arrow). This very much includes the Gray Wolves, who gather around their altar but approach the brooding stone raven no closer than that. They bury their dead and battle 
+_>'14) trophies (notably, an enchanted red dragon femur) “in front of” (south of) the depression, between it and the southern edge of the main plateau. The Black Ravens bury their dead and battle trophies (notably, a giant rock 
+_>'15) ring; hardened volcanic flow) on the three menhir-adorned plateaus.
The main plateau does have several natural caverns within it, that can be accessed from crevices in the north (the “back” of the plateau).
There are veins of 
+_>'16) adamantite (the ore that yields adamant, the hard but brittle metal that can be made into the tremendously tough, durable alloy of adamantine) running through the plateau, but any attempt to mine them are going to bring down 
+_>'17) repeated and fierce Uthgardt attacks on the miners.
There’s also a very large and pure vein of silver farther up the Black Raven River, within sight of the plateau and revealed by its gleam through the river’s rushing waters. 
+_>'18)
The Black Ravens and Gray Wolves would attack anyone trying to mine it, too; so far as they’re concerned, anyone entering the cleft is too close to the place they hold sacred—and where one group of intruders come 
+_>'19) more (in their experience) inevitably follow. (And dwarves and duergar of old likely delved out subterranean dwellings in the surrounding mountains, to use the river headwaters as a handy water source.)

+_>'1)
The woman who bore Victoro Casslanter went by the name “Lady Mask,” when in Waterdhavian clubs in the 1370s DR, where she fascinated Caladorn. She was a moon elf sorceress who never had any intention of marrying anyone or becoming
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) part of the Deep’s nobility or even open, polite society. She kept to human form (thin, lithe, graceful, mid-calf-length glossy black hair, very large bright blue eyes customarily surrounded by black makeup) when consorting 
+_>'3) with Caladorn, and used the name “Shalant Marndraeve.” (“Shalantra Marndrevven” in full.) She made her living under another human name and guise (as a plump, motherly blonde woman who looked about a decade older than 
+_>'4)
Shalant, and was known as “Ardraitha Toldren”), discreetly and covertly casting covert life-useful magics for those able to afford her fees (nobles and wealthy Waterdhavians and visitors to the city). Her real name was

Duskra Wyntervar, and her identity and all of her various guises were known to her “family;” she lived quietly in North Ward with three lifelong friends who were secretly Deep-resident song and steel dragons, and acted for 
+_>'6) them as an envoy and factor (trading representative).
She willingly surrendered her infant son to Caladorn to be raised as his heir, and even (as “Ravendra Emrespur,” borrowing the surname of a long-defunct family who’d once 
+_>'7) been minor Tethyrian gentry; this was something of an in-joke because various traveling actors and investors had in the past borrowed the Emrespur name for their own various false identities, so there are now Emrespurs 
+_>'8) everywhere in Faerûn) married him in a private ceremony, months before Victoro’s birth, to make the boy legitimate.
Although she often visited Caladorn by night, and mothered her baby on such occasions (which is where he 
+_>'9) learned the beginnings of Draconic and Elvish), she had almost nothing to do with the naming and raising of Victoro beyond that, something she was glad of in later years, when he turned to evil.
After Caladorn became Open Lord 
+_>'10) of Waterdeep, Lady Mask quietly vanished from the city. It’s thought that she and her family relocated to Everlund, and all took new names and guises, to found new lives in the North working to strengthen alliances and ties

Sun May 30 03:41:10 (Realmslore, Time of Troubles)

?_>'Hey [@] some quick cleric lore questions: first off, presuming their god is amenable, can a cleric create new spells? Saw your tweets about the Seven Mysteries and converting the arcane, but more generally how much latitude is there for the mortal to shape divine energy? 
+_>'1)
Hi!
The divine magic received by clerics is ALWAYS up to the deity (though bestowing spells in answer to a mortal’s prayers may often be delegated to their servitors). As the Time of Troubles showed us, magics up to and
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) including 3rd level are usually “automatically” granted (even when the deity isn’t paying attention or “on the job” at all), but not to an individual the deity is displeased with and so has cut off, or is paying particular 
+_>'3) attention to (and possibly substituting other spells than those prayed for, for the god’s own purposes).
So if the deity is amenable, a “new” prayer or even an existing one offered again can result in the bestowal of a new 
+_>'4) spell. The inspiration for how to wield it, and understanding of its casting, come from the deity. However, that’s an “IF.” Realms history tells us that deities rarely grant new spells, and priesthoods (the hierarchy of 
+_>'5) mortal clerics) almost always discourage maverick “freelancing” on the part of member clergy (because humans devote themselves to faith in large part to establish order and control in their lives, to benefit themselves and 
+_>'6) others thereby). So a cleric will usually be discouraged by superiors from trying to get “the unusual” from a deity.
However, ADVENTURING clerics (and paladins, and for that matter non-classed hermits and lay fanatics) are by 
+_>'7) definition the unusual mavericks in a faith, and if they please or entertain or seem very useful to a deity, new spells could well be granted.

Mon Feb 08 19:36:57 (Realmslore, Sembia, Starym, Vangerdahast)

?_>' [@] I’ve been doing some research into the High Elves of FR and I’ve learned many fascinating things, but I’m having trouble locating details on some of the logistics of their societies. Namely, how does High Elven aristocracy function? 
+_>'1)
Elves have families (they tend to dislike the term “clans” as being “too dwarvish”) of long lineage, some of them “high” and proud due to longtime wealth, power/social influence, and notable-achievements/reputations members.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Most elven societies are city-states, or realms that really encompass one or part of one forest with a number of settlements (often tree-dwelling, seldom with walls/fortifications or numerous built structures of stone, as 
+_>'3) opposed to living structures made from sculpted and “trained” still-alive trees), and they tend to be ruled by a coronal (a monarch) that is not always inherited (and in practise, thanks to warfare, is seldom inherited 
+_>'4) these days) advised by a council of elders, usually family matriarchs and patriarchs (the females tend to wield the most influence if they care to).
Usually elf families “own” individual trees that they live in, and burial 
+_>'5) crypts that they make or inherit, and guard (sometimes with baelnorns). The rest of an elf realm is commonly owned (elves would likely view this as “owned by none, shared by all creatures, under the stewardship of we Fair 
+_>'6)
Folk,” ‘stewardship’ in this case meaning partly gardening and partly guarding. A really proud family like the Starym might think of themselves as ruling and owning a demesne/estates (contiguous expanse of forest), but would 
+_>'7) only use the term “estates” if they were living in a human-dominated area (like the uplands of Sembia) in which they are legally owning (with deeds, etc.) a piece of land among the holdings of other (non-elven owners). And 
+_>'8) yes, elves are indeed far less materialistic than most races; the resources they most value are renewable living things, and what sustains them (water, rotting matter as fertilizer), that are part of the life cycles of the 
+_>'9) land.
There’s no formal feudal system, but elf families of standing in an elven realm are expected to contribute warriors and funds and resources (arrows, transport) to the defense of the realm (and in peacetime, do so daily 
+_>'10) in the form of patrols that often double as hunting parties). They are expected to master the bow and the sword (and in some elf societies, mounted combat) and to provide leadership within the elf community on matters of 
+_>'11) social policy and enterprises (businesses that emplpy and earn/enrich all), and the families as a whole are expected to provide food, shelter, care, and fuel to the elderly and infirm; “we are on this shared path together 
+_>'12) but at the same time all of us are finding our own way
In practise, elf “nobles” provide social leadership in the form of setting fashions, making certain games and pursuits and interests popular or not by what they 
+_>'13) themselves take an interest in, or don’t.
The reason I put quotation marks around the word nobles is because the actual titles used by elves (beyond the vague spoken honorifics of “lord, lady, knight” [[and a knight or 
+_>'14) senior noble, or someone a speaker believes to be a knight or senior noble, is usually addressed as “honoured,” so “Honoured Saer” or “Honoured Lady” is safely polite if you’re human who’s talking to a stranger elf]]) vary 
+_>'15) so widely from place to place and over time. Many human writers just settle for lord, lady, and knight (and sometimes “lady knight”) and leave it at that.
As Vangerdahast once said, “If an elf is pompous enough to correct 
+_>'16) you by providing a specific title, use it. If you want to be polite

+_>'1)
Hi!
First: Weave anchors are of two sorts: stationary "things"/sites (like the Athora in Thay) and mobile (usually beings, but sometimes items such as gems). Some of the mobile ones have the means to depart Toril, and are still Weave anchors, but the Weave 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) itself is a mere ghost they trail when outside Toril (i.e. they don't really extend the Weave to the "outside" locale, except insofar as Mystra being able to see and hear through them and communicate with them).
Second, many "known" Realms personalities are  
+_>'3)
Weave anchors, including: the Chosen, Manshoon, Mirt, Durnan, and Halaster. Some of them don't even know Mystra has made them so, and many of them are still "secret" Weave anchors to those who take an interest in such things. If you notice an NPC with a

Halruaan burial practices depend on the social status and wealth of a Halruaan.
The wealthiest and most magically powerful typically have favored family members cremated magically, to convert the carbon of their ashes into
Realmslore [:]

Still less wealthy cremate and leave disposal of the ashes to someone else, or just bury the ashes themselves.

Thu Dec 02 01:08:39 (Realmslore, Sword Coast, Thorass)

+_>'Allalinor Norix [@] was curious if there are any particular wedding customs that might be common within the FR, especially the Sword Coast.
In our almost 2 year long campaign we are trying to figure out what a wedding between two of the characters would be. 
+_>'To be more specific it would be between a noble forest gnome (previously half-elf) and noble half-dragon (previously elf) without either one having any strong connections to any deity
So my interests lies more in possible traditions/customs of the wedding ceremony itself. 
+_>'1)
Half-elf, gnome, and halfling weddings tend to be far more free-form (partners “craft their own”) than the ceremonies of other races, particularly when there isn’t strong deity or clan/family representation, so the key parts 
+_>'2) of it will be:
A processional to the place of the ceremony, ideally a woodland glade or streambank, but failing that, under a tree. Whoever is officiating sings the couple in, separately, or stands with a singer if the 
+_>'3) officiant can’t sing or the couple wants someone else to sing (often, a family member or mentor). If the union is between male and female, male approaches (is sung in) first, then female; if same-gender, older is sung in 
+_>'4) first, UNLESS the couple wants unison. Dress as they please, veils not a thing for these races, face towards/watch each other during the second approach.
The singing is known as a “calling song,” and there are both traditional 
+_>'5) songs and newly-written ones; it’s common to rewrite and personalize the lyrics.
When the couple-to-be are standing face to face, the officiant calls on any audience to witness the union, or speak against it (the only socially 
+_>'6) acceptable reason to do so is if the clan/realm of one or both of the couple-to-be only recognizes one marriage at a time to a person, and someone in the audience believes one or both are still married to someone else; there 
+_>'7) are tales of that “someone else” being in the audience and uttering a challenge at this time).
Absent any objection, the officiant delivers a very brief “sermon” that talks about the purpose/benefits of a union, and loyalty to 
+_>'8) it, and how loves grows within it if the couple work at it [if religious part of a wedding is strong, this is where the advice/commandments/views of the deities involved are uttered]. Then the older member of the couple-to-be 
+_>'9) is asked to speak to the person they’re going to wed, to make any promises they wish to, and profess their love (they sometimes say why the other person caught their eye and then won their heart, but this is entirely a 
+_>'10) personal speech, its form and content not dictated by tradition).
Then the younger member does the same thing, UNLESS the couple-to-be have decided beforehand on “younger first
Then the officiant calls again on everyone 
+_>'11) watching, and “all the gods” and “any spirits of this place” to witness the union, and the couple-to-be put bodily fluids on their left palms, and raise them vertically to touch each other (any sort of bodily fluid, but it’s 
+_>'12) usually spittle unless one of the couple-to-be is moved to tears, which will be used instead). They hold them firmly together as the officiant chants an ancient good-luck charm, in Thorass (it’s NOT deity-specific, but 
+_>'13) sounds like a prayer), and the couple embrace and kiss. They may exchange tokens (such as rings) at this time, or not, and half-elves have a custom of putting a token in their own mouths and kissing their new partner to 
+_>'14) transfer it into their mouth, but this is optional, and of course assumes the tokens are safe for such handling (i.e. not needles or blades).
And that’s it.
Traditional followups to the ceremony are dancing with music, that 
+_>'15) leads to a feast, followed by the couple going somewhere private to consummate and do a “first thing” together: plant a seed, go to a shared favorite place, or even undertake an expedition or quest.

?_>' [@] Good Morning Loremaster! Could you provide some insight as to the cuisine and drinks that are native to Shining South, Halruaa especially? Is there is a stark contrast between southern cuisine and the food and drink of the Savage Frontier and the Heartlands? 
+_>'1)
A huge topic, but here’s a starter
Yes, there is a contrast. More soups, stews, and heavy, warming food, plus food that travels well (sausages, round hardloaves of bread) in the North.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Shining South cuisine has more small meals, with savory and sweet tarts (dominated not by berries as in the North, but by caramel sauces and nuts), and mint and hot spices as seasonings.
Cheeses in both cuisines, but more soft 
+_>'3) and crumbly cheese in the South, used more in cooking, whereas in the North cheeses are more sturdy/portable/hard and eaten by hand or in wedges. The South has more strongly seasoned cheeses, with nuts and hot spices added 
+_>'4) and sweet-and-sour taste combinations are found only in the South (except where traveling merchants and their trade routes have caused individual migrations of cuisine to specific eateries, inns, and taverns). Pickles in the 
+_>'5)
North have tastes like our real-world modern “bread and butter” pickles or sour pickles; pickles in the South usually taste more fiery, like mustard pickles, and include chopped-olive and caper mixes like tapenades. 
+_>'6)
As for alcoholic drinks: in the North, mulled ciders and spiked-with-spirits hot broths and “slakes” (mixes of teas and root spices) and ale and firewine. In the South: chilled drinks, like the blue wine avanal and brandies 
+_>'7) poured over berries and shavings of ice, and wines in general in preference to beer, as well as kaeth (coffee) in preference to teas.
However, these cuisine contrasts are marked in rural and wilderness areas, but far less so 
+_>'8) in cosmopolitan trading cities, ports like Waterdeep, Baldur’s Gate, Athkatla, Zazesspur, and Calimport in particular, where visiting traders like to eat their customary foods, and arrive in profusion enough to support 
+_>'9) eateries offering their favourites.
Oh, and smoky food flavours are welcomed in the North (smoked fish, smoked meats) but in the South are often seen as a mark of poor cooking or attempts to hide bad-flavoured, spoiling food.

The Seven Mysteries are magical secrets that clergy of Azuth must learn, and master that knowledge by crafting new arcane spells that make use of these secrets. These arcane spells are then transformed into divine (cleric)
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) spells by the crafting of prayers that “work” to trigger the magical effects (Weave energy releases) by calling on the deity (which is what all divine magics do). The arcane versions of the spells are to be offered to 
+_>'3) wizards (and other spellcasters) who worship Azuth and aid Azuth’s clergy.
The Seven Mysteries are secrets, but it’s leaked out that the “first” (lowest, and most easily learned) Mystery is how clerics can craft arcane spells 
+_>'4) whether they personally possess the Gift (ability to wield the Art/arcane magic) or not (i.e. how they can call on Azuth to empower them as if they had the Gift, and how to control their Gift if they do have it). 
+_>'5)
The “second” (next learned) of the Mysteries is that prayers can be crafted that successfully turn an arcane spell into a divine one, and the general guidelines for how to do this.
It’s rumored that among the other five 
+_>'6) mysteries are advanced contingencies or defensive fields (like mantles cast by wizards) that can be “set” by a cleric of Azuth so as to automatically wink into existence, and defend that cleric, if the magic they are intended 
+_>'7) to thwart or lessen comes into contact with the protected cleric (so, they awaken by themselves, regardless of how busy the cleric is or even if the cleric is conscious or not).

?_>' [@] 
Greetings Great Sage,
I was perusing the Dragon Magazine archives for more information on the Plane of Mirrors and the Plane of Dreams.
The former amounted to about a sentence, and the latter popped up in more lurid sources.
Thus I ask whether you can shed light! 
+_>'1)
Hi! Sure!
There’s a very good overview of the Plane of Dreams here: [:]
As for the Plane of Mirrors, all that’s been officially published is summarized ably at the FRWiki.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Here we go with how I described it in a long-ago (1980) RPGA module (an official GenCon charity adventure, so canon):
Its entrances/exits (and windows) are mirrors, both natural and artificial reflective surfaces. When you’re 
+_>'3) within it, it seems to be an endless corridor, with walls, floor and ceiling lined with a myriad hodgepodge of different-sized windows (to beings on the “other side” of each of them, these are mirrors). 
+_>'4)
Radiant energy “leaks” into the Plane from the Positive Material Plane (yes, the PMP exists, as a transitive plane akin to the Plane of Mirrors but “thicker,” and looking like a void of endless white glowing mist) constantly 
+_>'5) repairing the mirrors and any damage to the surfaces that hold them (actually, within which they float). There are no growing things (food) native to the mirror plane, but many creatures have found their ways into it through 
+_>'6) the mirrors/windows, and some remain in it for a time, healing (the radiant energy benefits living things that aren’t necrotic/negative). They have brought a lot of items with them, over time, including food, and some of 
+_>'7) these things are still to be found in “the mirror realm” (or “Mirrorland,” as the dwarf adventurer Bueryndin called it).
The ”floor” of the Plane of Mirrors is actually its border with the Ethereal Plane; if you breach the 
+_>'8) floor BETWEEN mirrors/windows (which lead to wherever the other side of a particular mirror/reflective window is), you pass into the Ethereal Plane. Amid a sparkling chaos of particles borne on swirling air, and a chiming 
+_>'9) tinkling of those tiny particles clashing and rebounding.
Fresh air drifts through all of the mirrors/windows, replenishing the air of the Plane of Mirrors constantly, and occasionally imbuing it locally and temporarily 
+_>'10) with smoke, fog, and scents from the air “it’s coming from
It’s possible to store things in the Plane of Mirrors, but only by encasing them in mirror/reflective-surfaced coffers, coffins, or chests. Otherwise, they 
+_>'11) eventually drift through a mirror/window into the“otherwhere” on the far side of that surface.

Thu Oct 28 23:41:12 (Athkatla, Baldur's Gate, Dracorage, Harper, Helm, Lantan, Realmslore, Sembia, Shining South, Sword Coast, Tharsult, Velsaert, Wyrms of the North)

+_>'BadCatMan [@] [@] I'm curious about Velsaert, the Dragon Sage of Baldur's Gate quoted in a lot of the Wyrms of the North articles. What's his story? Was he always secretly a steel dragon? Are the other great dragons of the North really just avoiding him? 
+_>'1)
Velsaertirden was a steel dragon who hatched in a clutch of eggs in Steelspires, a castle built by stone giants for his parents on a bare rock ridge that towered over the busy human port city of Haunvaerune, on the continent 
+_>'2) of Arandron far to the southwest of Faerûn.
It was his mother Malavauvra’s (Malavauvrantarandra’s) last clutch of eggs, for she was ancient and ailing. Most of Velsaertirden’s siblings were sickly and died soon after 
+_>'3) hatching, or during their first year of existence. The exceptions were his ruthless, rapacious sister Rauvrahreene (Rauvrahrileenatandrar), and his brother Torthal (Torthalindrarron).
The three wyrmlings soon became dragonets 
+_>'4) (learning to take human form, and shift with ease between human and dragon form), and reacted in very different ways to the bustling human city their dying mother encouraged them to explore: Torthal was repelled by humans 
+_>'5) and wanted nothing to do with them, or cities, or crowding of any sort; Rauvrahreene saw them as cattle, pawns, and playthings to be manipulated, devoured, and otherwise expended at will to further her needs to dominate, cow 
+_>'6) lesser beings, and further her plans; and Velsaert saw them as dangerous but fascinating sources of ongoing entertainment, to be studied and befriended and worked with to see what they’d do and achieve.
Velsaert’s father 
+_>'7)
Phaudron (Phaudrantanthildrar) was a withdrawn, singleminded sort of dragon who traveled widely to explore and find rare substances to use as material components in arcane magics he was devising and endlessly experimenting 
+_>'8) with.
His passion was magics intended to prolong draconic life and vigor indefinitely, without lichdom or other necromantic means, for most dragons who survive for many years love life and want to cling to it, and seek 
+_>'9) longevity by various means.
While her father was away on one of his expeditions to gain a rare ingredient, Rauvrahreene found some of his written records of his magical experimentations.
She copied them, went to a lair of her 
+_>'10) own she’d established elsewhere, and conducted her own spellcastings and experiments, successfully learning how to reverse Phaudron’s spells. Then she returned to Steelspires, and when her father returned, weary and 
+_>'11) unsuccessful, she covertly cast his reversed spells on him, killing him.
Emboldened, she sought out her weak, slumbering mother, and slew her the same way. The castle was now hers.
However, Torthal unexpectedly returned to 
+_>'12)
Steelspires to consult his father, and found his sister fortifying the place with dragonslaying traps. One of which sorely wounded him (he discovered the traps the hard way). Rauvrahreene gloated openly over the mortally 
+_>'13) wounded Torthal—and was overheard doing so by Velsaert, making his own return visit to the castle. Outraged that he’d lost his parents, Velsaert attacked, and when the battle was done, Torthal had been blasted apart and 
+_>'14)
Rauvrahreene, wounded, had fled.
Lost in grief, Velsaert decided he never wants to dwell in the castle. He searched it, and used all the magic he knew to subvert and reset the traps so if Rauvrahreene returned, they’d likely 
+_>'15) harm her. Then Velsaert took human form and went down into Haunvaerune.
Where as soon as he could, he took passage on a farsailing ship, that would call at “strange and distant ports
In this case, that meant Sambar, in 
+_>'16)
Lantan (unbeknownst to wider Faerûn, the Lantanna traded their lesser invented devices with many farflung folk, to gain goods rare or hard to find). From there, Velsaert found his way to mainland Faerûn, where he traveled 
+_>'17) for over five centuries in various human guises, seeing much of different cultures.
As he grew older, he increasingly sided with the aims and doings of the Harpers of Twilight Hall, and joined them while posing as the human 
+_>'18) ranger Vontur of Zazesspur.
During his sixty-odd years as Vontur, he came across several tantalizing mentions of a dragon who MIGHT be his sister Rauvrahreene, but could never track her down. Velsaert was also increasingly 
+_>'19) fascinated by the magic-spreading role of the Chosen of Mystra, and watched their doings—and so, in return, was watched by them.
Eventually, Vontur was cornered in a perish-or-call-on-draconic-powers situation, so Vontur 
+_>'20) died” and the dragon that slew him and his foes flew away. .and a young woman by the name of Shalant Mornwind, hailing from Athkatla, joined the Harpers. An eager volunteer daunted by nothing and avoiding no unpleasant task 
+_>'21) nor company, she rose in the regard of senior Harpers, and gained an ever-larger role as a trusted and capable adventurer, active all over western Faerûn, until, in an undercover operation in the Sembian city of Selgaunt 
+_>'22) she discovered that the secret of the success of the wealthy local Sembian family hight House Morarshar was due to their matriarch, Lady Ambrele, being the human guise of Velsaert’s sister Rauvrahreene. 
+_>'23)
Velsaert attacked, and in the battle that followed, Morarshar Hall was torn apart, the family and their staff died bloodily, several surrounding buildings were shattered and hurled down, Rauvragrene was maimed and forced to 
+_>'24) flee to another plane of existence, and Shalant Mornwind “died
In truth, Velsaert was aged three centuries by spells cast by Rauvrahreene to try to kill him, and left saddened by the deaths of his Harper adventuring 
+_>'25) colleagues and the destruction of so much of what had been a luxurious street in downtown Selgaunt.
So he “retired,” becoming a sage in Baldur’s Gate under the name of Imbryn Velsaert (borrowing the name Imbryn from Imbryn 
+_>'26)
Ultal, the captain of the Aelusteen, the ship that had brought him from Haunvaerune to Sambar). Velsaert dwelt above his small shop in the Temples District (a street above the Helm and Cloak inn), quietly selling information 
+_>'27) and old books related to magic, and becoming a passive observer of all the bustling human activity around him. Noticing the great extent to which various humans were being manipulated by clergies, cults, cabals, and powerful 
+_>'28) entities like illithids, beholders, and dragons, he increasingly slipped into human guises to travel and investigate the doings and aims of various dragons and dracoliches active in western Faerûn (notably Laerahkralan, a 
+_>'29) greatwyrm working with yuan-ti and human agents to covertly influence various ruling courts, from towns and villages up to countries, in the Shining South). He located their principal lairs and watched what he could of their 
+_>'30) activities, befriending the bronze dragon Nymmurh in particular. During the 1360s and 1370s DR, Velsaert gained a reputation as “the” current expert on the lives and times of the dragons of the Sword Coast. 
+_>'31)
The merchant Andlar Verikho of Tharsult dubbed him the “Dragon Sage,” and this nickname stuck.
After the Dracorage, an ashamed and regretful Velsaert wanted nothing further to do with the Harpers, and foresaw that his 
+_>'32) profession as a sage specializing in dragons was going to bring endless adventurers (Harpers among them) to his door, so he “retired” again, relocating to the Upper City and later the south side of the river, and then 
+_>'33) dropping out of sight.
Just in time, it seems, for a force of mages and able-to-pass-as-human creatures he suspects was sent by sister, or someone working for her, descended on his lodgings by night to slay him—and when they

?_>'Hey there [@] have an odd little question for you - what can you tell me about arispeg, delph, and marka? These are fictional spices brought up in the old Campaign Setting sourcebook. The only details provided are that the Highmoon Trading Coster traded in them. 
+_>'1)
SO pleased you asked about these. I’ve been sitting on this lore for YEARS.
ARISPEG is a green, segmented “spear” weed that looks like real-world horsetails, except that it always bends, as it grows, a few inches above the soil
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) to run parallel to the ground, not sticking up vertically. This keeps it from being destroyed when trodden on. Arispeg grows along the Tashalar coast (and on up around Lapal shore almost as far as Ormpur), in the salt-spray

+_>'4) false lobster” salad or soup can be made with it that tastes like lobster, without including any actual lobster at all.
DELPH is a yellowish, sharp-onion-tasting powder derived from crushing and drying yellow wildflowers that 
+_>'5) grow all over high waste ground in Unther, Mulhorand, Chessenta, and Threskel (still plentiful in the Akanapeaks, but now harvested heavily elsewhere). It never molds or mildews or spoils no matter how damp it gets, or how 
+_>'6) much time passes (three-centuries-old delph has been used and enjoyed, though its taste “thins” a little as time passes), and in fact can be sprinkled on moldy rugs or clothing, rolled up tight for a month, and will 
+_>'7) kill/banish the mold (not reverse its effects, but kill its spores so they can’t come back). So it’s a hardy travel spice, used a little like mustard, but doesn’t tint anything yellow; when cooked, it goes clear.
MARKA is the 
+_>'8) ground-up branches of a thorn bush that grows mainly in the foothills in Murghom and Semphar. It’s dark red/maroon, almost black when wet, and imparts a hearty “fried meat” taste (the FR equivalent of “cheeseburger”) to

Is there anything you can share on its history and how it functions? I'm curious how they compare.

Here’s a starter:
Waterdeep’s sewers are tidal, and cleaned by the merfolk and some powerful Ahghairon-cast (and Watchdul Order-renewed) spells that involve mass teleports to the Rat Hills.

It has big versions of the sort of boxes many of us now have in our basements, that prevent backups (the gate that is pushed up by sewage coming the wrong way, to close the opening).
The oldest parts are a large semicircular 
+_>'3) channel that runs around (inland side) the spur of Mount Waterdeep that juts out into Castle Ward (and that Sea and North Wards drain into), and drains through Dock Ward, and two trunk sewers that drain South and Trades Ward

The authorities have long been aware of the perils of allowing a network of underground easy-passage routes, so spiked

Once approved or amended, local artists can be commissioned to paint the blazon if the owner wants it

Baldur’s Gate first appeared in a Realms short story I wrote entitled “The Box That Crept On Talons” in 1968. (Yes, six years before D&amp;D first appeared.)

I’ve forgotten when the first mention of Baldur’s Gate made it into The Dragon, but the first time I mentioned it in an

+_>'6) bedchamber of a noble’s tallhouse in Baldur’s Gate, up on the peninsula that shelters the ‘bowl’ of the main city).
Baldur’s Gate was not named for Baldr or Balder (the son of Odin and Frigg), but for a character I’d created 
+_>'7) who lived there before the city grew up around him and the natural sheltered harbour at the rivermouth: a dwarf named Harbaldur, a smith who made a living forging grand, ornamented, but massively strong gates for castles and

Balduran” was added later by TSR (I think by Tim Beach), though I did have a seafaring explorer who sailed west out of Baldur’s Gate to explore the seas, named Shala Lonstur (a halfling lady who disappeared from lore

And I’ve coined literally thousands of names

Smokepowder is solely alchemical. Meaning: a secret formula (secret to the priests of Gond, a "temple secret"). Which means quite a few people outside the clergy have figured out most of the ingredients, but the precise proportions and how to mix them is a matter

So far as Elminster knows (and his source is the goddess Mystra, who possessed Elué during her births of silver-haired females all destined to be famous), the half-elf Elué Shundar (who never seems to have use “Silverhand” as

Where Dornal’s aged mother, confined to bed and dying, accepted Elué with open arms as the “sorceress in the

On foot, quite happily. Except when riding in goat- or mule-drawn carts for transporting-goods reasons, or sledges in winter snow.
As I wrote in Volo’s Guide To Cormyr (although an editor removed all the commas between the 
+_>'2) place names in that sentence), Redspring lies in “ideal grazing country because of their numerous ponds and rivulets, and so numerous shepherds and keepers of herds of goats, cattle, and other herd animals have come to live 
+_>'3) here over the years
Which should make it obvious that it doesn’t lie in the Stonelands proper. The term “Stonelands” is used locally in upland/back country Cormyr specifically to mean the terrain of knife-edge exposed 
+_>'4) bedrock ridges with breakneck-steep ravines between, not “everything up north, there,” as a dockworker or shopkeeper who’s never left Suzail might think of it; to outlanders and folk who live in Suzail and Marsember, the

Stonelands may be a big east-west band that marks where the settled realm ends, on the north, but to folk in Eveningstar and Arabel, things are more nuanced.
So there are fingers of topsoil-covered terrain reaching north into 
+_>'6) the Stonelands in several places. Redspring is in one of them. It stands in well-watered (many springs rising, and flowing down and out of it), hilly but with topsoil, ranching country.
Hillmarch is also located in the same 
+_>'7) sort of countryside: rolling hills, with very little level ground, but topsoil and not bare rock ridges. There are exposed rock faces (cliffs your sheep can fall over) here and there, but plenty of wild grass-covered dirt to 
+_>'8) walk around on.
Redspring gets its name from the reddish hue of the springs that rise in it (the local drinking water), which is red due to a lot of dissolved iron from the rocks beneath. If there weren’t richer, better iron 
+_>'9) deposits much farther south and closer to the coast, there’d likely be iron mines near Redspring. As it is, it’s ranching country, shipping wool and mutton, goats and goat-milk cheese, and smoked, salted sides of beef south

SteamCelt Resists While Vaccinated [@] what would El consider a "must try"? I'd rather hear that. :53 PM · Nov 9, 2021

Right now in Waterdeep, El would most likely recommend someone try a tatha, visit the City of the Dead, and seek out Old Naecza to talk to.
A tatha is the latest widespread street food of the city, originating with sailors wanting to eat cheap, quickly-served  
+_>'2) food found in other ports and so supporting one of their own setting up a Dock Ward shopfront, and swiftly spreading. Similar to the “bunny chow” of real-world South Africa, a tatha consists of a hot bread load hollowed out and stuffed with a hotspice fry-mix

Elminster wants folk to visit the City of the Dead (by day, of course!) to experience a green, pleasant park in the middle of a crowded city that folk use to snack, stroll and chat, tryst, and honour their dead kin or forebearers in a

?_>'Hey [@] another Waterdeep question for you. I was looking over a couple of the different official maps the city has had over the years and I was wondering - do these three unlabeled stretches of road have names by any chance? [:] 
+_>'1)
They do. ;} The purple route is the southern end of The Cliffwatch (don’t be misled by the ground furrows, and the open ground along the clifftop that isn’t a street: The Cliffwatch runs south from where its name-label appears on the map, and Saerdoun Street and 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Zendulth [formerly “Zenduth,” before the name got corrupted, over time] both branch off of it). This southern end is also known as “Watchway
The red route is Malkur’s Ride.
The green route that connects The Beaconmarch with Malkur’s Ride is Selvur Alley 
+_>'3) the cul-de-sac jutting north off it is Handaramatur’s Court, and the serpentine alley that crosses Selvur Alley (all of the rest you’ve highlighted in green) is Dathantar’s Crawl.
Malkur was an irascible and villainous independent adventurer-mage of the early  
+_>'4) s DR who refused to join the Watchful Order; this was the street he memorably used to gallop along on a phantom mount he’d conjured up, while experimenting with a new spell he was devising (it worked fine, as an ever-increasing-velocity rushing movement he 
+_>'5) couldn’t slow or turn abruptly, and he very quickly tired of being slammed with bone-shattering force against buildings on the west front of Zendluth Street).
Selvur was a doppelganger posing as a Calishite merchant in the late 1200s DR, who bought several  
+_>'6) buildings in the city block the alley named for him now bisects; he created the alleyway by tearing down decaying buildings he’d bought and building smaller-footprint, taller ones that left room for a cut-through; the Palace was pleased and cut him a tax  
+_>'7) break, unaware that they were assisting in housing a growing community of doppelgangers.
Handaramatur was a sage in the early 1300s DR whose expertise was genealogies of common Waterdhavians to date, the trade agreements and therefore ties between them, the  
+_>'8) businesses they founded, and their guild memberships; he dwelt in the building at the north end of the court that doesn’t front on Malkur’s Ride, but adjoins one that does. He died of a “contagious fever” in the harsh winter of 1331 DR, and the “shady secrets 
+_>'9) he’d written down in his researches were never found (either someone pounced on them right away, or they’re still hidden somewhere in the aging three-storey house, which has had more than a dozen owners since).
Dathantar was a famous-in-his-day nightsoil wagon 
+_>'10) operator of the early 1200s DR, who lived somewhere along the alleyway now named for him, and used to stop his aromatic, laden wagon to snatch a bite to eat at home with his wife, so the wagon was said to “crawl” along this stretch by neighbours because its stench lingered.

In winter, anyone can "harvest wild ice" near Waterdeep, from ponds and marshes and the banks of rivers and streams.
The rest of the year: several nobles with holdings along the banks of the River Dessarin have long-standing agreements with the Watchful Order of

Mon Aug 30 04:21:07 (Realmslore, Toril)

?_>' [@] Thank you for this, Sir! Can you share the Draconic words for numbers? 
+_>'1)
Certainly.
One = ir (pronounced “urr”)
Two = do (“doe” or “doah”)
Three = klau (“claw”)
Four = tveth (“tuh-VETH”)
Five = kloal (“kuh-LOW-ull”)
Six = saqqa (“sah-KWUH”)
Seven = tlokel (“tuh-LOCK-ell”)
Eight = hrist (“hur-ISSSt”)
Nine = vaeve (“VAY-vuh”)
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Ten = vok (“VOKE” to rhyme with “woke”)
Dragons of Toril generally count by sixes (groups of six): one group of six is saqqa, twelve is two groups of six and so, “dosaqqa” (doe-sah-KWUH”), eighteen is three groups of six and so, “klausaqqa,” and so on. 
+_>'3)
Sixty or voksaqqa functions somewhat like a hundred for Common Tongue speakers, being the “larger group” (for dragons, usually counting the size of a herd or edibles, or a group of humans/demi-humans/humanoids on the move or in a settlement) unit. 
+_>'4)
So instead of two hundred, three hundred, and so on, most dragons count in sixties: voksaqqa, then “saqqado” for one hundred and twenty, then “saqqaklau” for one hundred and eighty, and so on.
If a dragon is counting precisely for an amount above sixty:  
+_>'5) for 63, the count is rendered “klaulasaqqa.” In Draconic, 366 is “saqqalasaqqatlokel.” (Yes, 300 is “saqqasaqqa.”)
For many dragons, precise counting is for hoards or dragons; for other creatures, they often count "a few" = lauth or "many" = throden.

Sun Aug 08 20:50:22 (Forgotten Realms, Moonsea, Realmslore, the Realms)

+_>'Nomiem [@] Good morning, Sir. I've recently been writing a new iteration of a character I played for the last few years and I've been suggested to ask for your help. Honestly, I really love Forgotten Realms, but due to lack of time I couldn't study them the 
+_>'way I needed to.
Also it would be an honour for me to get advice from one such as you
So, these are my questions:
My character is a sorcerer, heir of an important dynasty born from a Silver Dragon. I intended for his family to have a palace in a cold and snowy place, but  
+_>'I really can't find a spot for it to fit in, so I wanted to ask for some suggestions.
One of this character dynasty features is to have a little dragon scale growing on some heirs' neck. This scale gets then removed and forged into a necklace, as it is seen as a strength  
+_>'and luck sign. I wanted to ask if it is an original yet lore coherent detail.
I wanted one of my character descendants to turn into a Lich and use one of his phylacteries on the dynasty palace, to secretly plan a return in complete safety. Although, while thinking about it  
+_>' again I realized I could've mistaken the Lich transformation process, so I wanted to ask the precise steps and if it's possible to use a phylactery the way I described.
Hope these doubts reach out to you, thanks in advance for the answer! 
+_>'1)
Hi, well met! Happy to try to help with Realmslore. There are many, many cold snowy places in the Realms, if you don’t mind mountaintops, and quite a few locales at any latitude north of the north shore of the Moonsea, so—how 
+_>'2) remote do you want the palace to be? In Faerûn? And “palace” implies the family rules from it, so. .close to or far from which neighbours? (As in, who do you want to be next door with an army at their command? Or not? ;} ) 
+_>'3)
The dragon scale works for originality, but only in the sense your family is using it in. Many folk in the Realms carry or display dragon scales of too small a size to be made into shields or armor, as trophies (as in “I slew 
+_>'4) the dragon whose scale this was”), and it’s likely that most folk meeting a member of your family and seeing such a scale will think it’s that sort of battle-trophy.
As for the process of achieving lichdom, it’s something many 
+_>'5) wielders of the Art achieve through a combination of research and experimentation, and so their processes, like the form their phylacteries take, vary a bit. The original lich description told us all the bare bones basics 
+_>'6) (use of a magic jar spell, etc.) and then Len Lakofka, in an early Dragon article, expanded what we “knew” into a complete process, but it’s clear from what many designers have written since that various spellcasters achieve 
+_>'7) lichdom by slightly different means, so it’s highly likely that if your DM, or you as DM, want the lich character’s plan to work, it will. But then again. . ;} Reading your post, I’m not quite sure what the character is planning

Although they share a descriptive term, bloodstone trade bars are far different from the “trade bars” of metal that change hands so often in trading across Faerûn. Bloodstone trade bars are flat plaques of dark gray alloy
Realmslore [:]

The alloy is halduthra, is of 
+_>'4) ancient gnomish invention, incorporates nickel, zinc, copper, tin, and some secret mineral ingredients, and is fairly light (though bloodstone is not).
A common sort of 25 gp bloodstone trade bar is flat, smooth, with rounded 
+_>'5) edges, is about 6 inches long, an inch and a half across, and three-quarters of an inch thick. And it will weigh in at about 0.65 lbs or .3 kg.

+_>'1)
Heh. Grabbed the wrong lore-file in my haste. Sorry!
Baldur's Gate's sewers are really simple by comparison, thanks to the oldest parts of the city being built in a steep-sided bowl: they have always worked by gravity and pumps.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Unlike the “flatter” sort of extensive sewer system, with walkways and cellars connected, etc, they consist of many, many small-bore (by comparison with Waterdeep; the clay pipes (laid in flanged sections that fit into each 
+_>'3) other and are sealed with concrete) get up to about six feet in diameter in the largest, lowest sections. They’re only larger in junction rooms, where pipes meet (and only a few of these have shafts with wall-grabiron ladders 
+_>'4) leading down to them, because of the tendency of these to back up and run out onto the surface during storms; the rooms tend to be where “plugs” occur in the system, and the access shafts are always under unmortared 
+_>'5) lift-up slabs (rectangular stone “manholes”) located in streets, so any back overflows that DO occur run on down the street and down gratings lower down, and so, back into the system.
These underground “runs” descend in 
+_>'6) parallel from the plateau around the bowl (in early days, just from the north-side “sea wall” ridge where the mansions of the nobles and the wealthy stood), and as the Gate has expanded, the mules-trudging-in-circles-powered 
+_>'7) pumps that pulled seawater uphill to fill cisterns that flushed the sewers were augmented by pumps farther and farther away from the bowl, that pumped water along the increasingly-long horizontal sewer runs to the edges of 
+_>'8) the bowl where gravity could start doing most of the work. These “outer pumps” have traditionally been located in local Watchposts, the fortified stone barracks/ready rooms/armories/jails structures, to guard the pump 
+_>'9) mechanisms and their mules from mischief, by the simple means of having the Watch squatting atop them.
That’s the brute-simple majority of the system.
The problems arose with the tidal nature of the river estuary in Baldur’s 
+_>'10)
Gate (which is also its harbor, and is crossed by many ferries and barges daily, particularly before the upper city expanded and bridges were built). Tides brought sewage back to its source, and into the pumps, so the system 
+_>'11) was pumping sewage to flush sewage, and the smells and disease (and fouled pumps) got bad.
That’s where the pipes and valves come in, and why Sewer Keep was built (which is a solids settling tower, just as a septic tank is a 
+_>'12) settlement container for solids to go to the bottom and eventually be rodded or pumped out and carted away, in the Gate’s case upriver to be spread on fields as fertilizer to grow crops for the ever-larger, ever-hungrier 
+_>'13) city). This was a Church of Gond-designed system, and works to prevent untreated sewage flushing out into the river and sea, only to be shoved right back into the pump intakes by currents, storms, and the tides.
This newer 
+_>'14) filtration system makes use of intermediate-flow pumps and cellar settling-chambers under the upper city (so, voila! Your underground labyrinth appears!) to circulate sewage through gratings and settling “wells” to clean it 
+_>'15) for use in flushing. The gratings and the bottoms of these wells need to be cleaned regularly.
Disease has lessened in the city since regular wagon shipments of clean drinking water from inland began, and the upriver

Sat Jun 12 17:48:45 (Gargauth, Jergal, Moander, Realmslore, Unther)

?_>' [@] How different? 
+_>'1)
My” original Unther was an ancient kingdom, ruled by a royal family who claimed to be “of the blood of the gods” and to regularly be “the consorts of gods” (i.e. gods privately visited them, had sex with them, and gave them
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) special powers AND missions/tasks for themselves and the realm). This claimed special status infuriated the senior nobles of the kingdom, who believed it was a fiction concocted to allow the royal family to erode the rights 
+_>'3) and powers of the nobility, and take all unto themselves.
Their problem was: it wasn’t a fiction; gods DID visit the royal family (the House of Haelcaunter) and charge them with tasks (these gods being: Gargauth, Moander 
+_>'4)
Shar, Jergal, and various of the Seven Lost Gods, most of them seeking to worm their way back into more personal power, except Jergal, who was trying to manipulate the doings of the royal family “sideways” into longterm 
+_>'5) regional stability rather than the chaos that Shar and Gargauth, in particular, were pushing Unther towards).
Down on the daily life level, Unther was a verdant realm of barley farms and beer, craftworkers (weavers especially) 
+_>'6) and stonemasons, barges and canals and “haemdra,” who are all ten to twenty year olds that didn’t exhibit the Gift (ability to wield the Art); they serve as unpaid laborers (slaves in all but name, though they had rights to 
+_>'7) food and shelter and good treatment) for that decade, wherever the realm wanted them to work (usually building or repairing roads, bridges, drainage pipes and ditches, and buildings), ere the state gave them some land of 
+_>'8) their own and full citizenry.
Unther had a professional army that also served as police and patrolled heavily, had laws that made innovations common property, and had an energetic fashion (personal garments, cosmetics, and 
+_>'9) hairdos) scene, and had abundant gold mining that made gold-and-jet fashion adornments relatively cheap and therefore popular, and gold finger-rings widely used as currency. Unther’s coins were small and copper, or large and 
+_>'10) gold, and in either case triangular.
The nobles were a fractious, feuding lot who ached for independence, but couldn’t achieve it because their bodyguards were strictly limited in size so as not to become private armies, the 
+_>'11) royal family had a cadre of courtiers specifically dedicated to spying on the nobles, and every noble family wanted to rule a new land consisting of their traditional lands that they were Malacht/Malrayess [=Duke/Duchess] 
+_>'12) over, PLUS in all cases some territory they had their eyes on, that belonged to another neighbouring Malachtam. Unther’s traveling traders were known as urdolphim, and some were clever, innovative mountains-of-coin.

Priests of almost all faiths, and family matriarchs, all across Toril, are indeed the first line of defense against what most folk of Faerûn call "afflictions of the mind," and their first reaction is usually to comfortingly "be with" the afflicted, to banish 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) loneliness and let them talk of what they're feeling. Tea and cordials (often mixed with "a little something" herbal) are always part of this. From there, things progress to alchemists and "wise women," plus local priests (or traveling holy folk), and their

+_>'4) just an attack). Like postal/message and item delivery services, treatment of the grieving and in shock and exhausted and mentally ill is a "standard" temple service, and one of the main reasons clergy (and not just deities) are so accepted/financially  
+_>'5) supported by the populace. Like any treatment, priests and the spells they use vary in efficacy and skills and success when it comes to individual cases, but at the very least, treatment can buy time for minds (and family members or friends) to rest.

?_>' [@] You are actually correct. It's a point I make in my videos. The relationships between them are super important. That'll come up more in my next video.

If PCs are to have free will (not be divine pawns) then gods must be fallible (like the Greek or Roman pantheons), not all-knowing/all-seeing. The power balances and relationships among/between deities shift all the time; I have always roleplayed them.

?_>' [@] Where precisely is Yartar, relative to the River Dessarin? It's described in the SC Adventurer's Guide and other 5e materials as "situated in the fork where the Rivers Surbrin and Dessarin join," and as a result some fan-created maps of the city show the city 1/5 
+_>'1)
Yartar began as a ferry-base (ferries as in: barges tethered to cables stretched across both rivers, from timber pilings on the banks designed to hold even sagging ropes above the river flow) across both the Surbrin and the
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
Dessarin, so it does indeed occupy the northeastern “angle” between the two rivers as they join. As Yartar grew into a town, it expanded across the Surbrin to the west bank (the easiest area to swiftly evacuate if an orc 
+_>'3) horde came sweeping south), and eventually that ferry got augmented by (not replaced by) a bridge.
Over time, as Yartar became an important town, it got its first defensive wall (really a ditch with an earthen rampart topped 
+_>'4) by a palisade of logs) in an arc from the Surbrin to the Dessarin, using the fast-flowing rivers as the other “walls.” This increased density in the defended area, choking the streets and leading to taller buildings, and

Trollskull is older construction, and not of the most expensive, but is a “manor,” its second floor would also be of fieldstone. Inside these walls rise the support timbers of a box-framed truss, with any floors above the

+_>'4) (overlapping hump-shaped rectangular roof-tiles that overhang the walls by at least a foot and have downspouts), and the lime-ash floors throughout would be covered with flat, glazed tiles. The house would have garderobes 
+_>'5) jakes (internal toilets/washrooms) flushed by roof-cisterns (pullchain), down interior-wall pipes into the sewers, internal stairs, and closets between rooms for sound privacy. Bedchambers would be on upper floors, attics 
+_>'6) would be for cisterns and old-furniture storage (and sometimes the rearing of caged pigeons as meat-birds for the household), and the servants would sleep in the kitchens, pantries (typical back door location), and entry-room 
+_>'7) for added security. There would be heavy wooden doors for interior rooms, with exposed stout wooden frames, and the only place where there MIGHT not be doors would be a wood-framed, square arch connecting the largest

Windows would be blown glass, in small diamond frames (replacements can readily be purchased from the

+_>'1)
It depends. ;} On where and when in the Realms you’re speaking of. The short answer is: all temples have their own internal rules/regs, and all faiths have their secular principles and precedents. Whatever the temple elders
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) and/or temple patriarch/matriarch may think, the local secular ruler (if there is one; this may not apply to an isolated monastery) will believe THEIR laws and enforcement of same MUST prevail.
So, it depends.
Sometimes, BOTH 
+_>'3) temple and then (punished miscreants handed over) secular justice will apply, and in other cases the temple will quietly circumvent local secular authority by either “making a deal” with said miscreants (usually along the 
+_>'4) lines of “do this trifling but dangerous service for us, and we’ll forget about what you were just caught doing”), or exacting punishment (e.g. executions and “shoot, shovel, shut up” temple-grounds burials) that make local 
+_>'5) secular justice moot.
In the particular situation you cite, if the someone broke into a Lathanderite granary and vandalized or set fire, it will be a temple penance (fine plus a service, like highly dangerous and involving 
+_>'6) travel and delivery) PLUS handed over to Crown (of Cormyr) justice.
If the someone broke in to look around, or just to steal grain, Lathanderites might be very lenient, depending on motives (is this a “new beginning” the 
+_>'7) break-in artist is trying to support or bring about?), and might cast a geas or similar magic compelling an immediate service on said artist, and not mention what happened to the authorities at all. If they can gain a servant 
+_>'8) of the temple (however reluctant/unwilling) out of this, it’s a benefit that far outstrips just delivering someone unto secular punishment and perhaps making them an ongoing local problem for everyone.

The original "home" Realms campaign has now reached the 1340s DR, but (as my players vote on things) we're still playing AD&amp;D and the Time of Troubles has never happened. However, play is VERY slow as everyone's scattered all over the world and is very busy.

The Company of Crazed Venturers was retired (again, players vote) long ago, and the Knights have retired some characters and taken up play with descendants and new recruits.

?_>'Ok this one is throwing me for a loop, [@] Elbulder is said to be a regular town in most books but Prayers of the Faithful and Magister both say the city was a monster-infested ruin R there 2 Elbulders? Was there a period of time when it was hidden from folk? Help? 
+_>'1)
You have stumbled on an untold tale of the Realms. As in, a computer game license (back in the days of cartidges and consoles) that, AFAIK, never got made.
There are indeed two Elbulders.
The older one is the monster-haunted, abandoned ruin that was going to be 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) the setting for the game (which was a mainly-above-ground dungeon; think of the up-and-down and around corners streets we see in the fighting in Dale, in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies), that was never rebuilt after its abandonment because of the  
+_>'3) wild magic and living spells still active in it (it got that way after both sides in a pitched battle to rule it used reckless magic, that collided and combined and got away from their control, utterly).
The newer one is “just next door.” What happened was:  
+_>'4) old Elbulder had a stream running through it that got put into pipes and used for drinking water, and then passed out of Ebulder and drained into the River Arran. Elbulder couldn’t expand upstream/east, along the banks of the Arran, because of a second  
+_>'5) stream, that rose as a spring to form a big marshy area.
When Old Elbulder was abandoned, a new and much smaller community (“new” Elbulder, or just “Elbulder”) was built east of this marsh, on the banks of the Arran, and the Old Road was re-routed to reach  
+_>'6) the Arran through it, at a spot that like old Elbulder took the road across the river via a wagon-ferry (big barge on cables), but unlike the old site, was situated at a spot where the river was narrower and shallower, so over time a ford could be built by  
+_>'7) dumping stones into the river in a raised but submerged roadbed.
Because this was going to be the basis for an outside-license game, and therefore hush-hush until the game's big release, this local Realmslore just never got mentioned in print. Until now.

?_>' [@] Ed would you be able to offer any hint about the namesake for Yeven’s Shrine or Yevenwood or the Pool of Yeven?

They are all named for the long-ago archmage Yeven, who dwelt on the banks of the pool, and later in a “pocket plane” tower IN the Pool (it was visible only in moonlight, as a ghostly solitary cylindrical turreted tower).

Yeven was an energetic experimenter with spells and creator of magical things, including many gates to other planes and skyships. When he died, his many links to his own wards around his home tethered his sentience and soul

?_>'Wanna do a deep dive of Candlekeep lore? Why not. Have I done that yet? Not sure. Screw it, lets try to find all the Candlekeep lore out there. I love Candlekeep, always have. One of my favorite Realms locations. 
?_>'I'm looking for any pre-campaign setting stuff in Dragon. Can't find any, so let's assume the old grey box is the first appearance. [:] 
?_>'The 2e box would expand Candlekeep a bit, and provide us with the first image of the library. [:]

?_>'Miirym protects Candlekeep, bound into service by a powerful mage for eating books and scholars. [:] 
?_>'It also adds a new bit of lore The Echoes of Alaundo magical gems with actual voice recordings of Alaundo reading some of his prophecies. 
?_>'Alaundo is a fantastic bit of plot device you can add to your campaigns, as he basically can help DMs be a foreshadower of what's to come for the PC's in your campaign

?_>'There is no mention of that in this book as far as I can tell.

?_>'Wait, [@] is poking around twitter I see him. Lets see if I can get him to answer :)
Hey, Ed, what's your favorite thing about Candlekeep? 
+_>'1)
Heh. The secrets I haven't revealed yet (I'm not just being flippant. There are centuries of lore in the place. I could only share a glimpse in THE HERALD, and a little more in the Candlekeep Companion. So there's plenty to look forward to in the forthcoming 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) official Candlekeep tome. I love the lineup of adventure writers, and Chris Lindsay is good people; Candlekeep is in good hands under his watch.
But here's a secret I've never shared with him or anyone*: Candlekeep has hidden rooms. As in, hidden in solid 
+_>'3) rock, with hourglasses that start trickling at any intrusion, to warn the arrival of how much breathing time they have left. Some of the most precious and powerful tomes are kept in these "Deep Chambers." Anyone can leave one through a magical gate, by  
+_>'4) glowing pair of footprints on the floor. But to find the gate to get in, you have to peer at doorframes. As in, the right trio of doorframes, scattered among the many, many doors in Candlekeep.
And by doorframes, I mean the revealed-when-a-door-is-open edge  
+_>'5) of the stone wall the door passes through, on the hinge side, right down where this edge meets the floor. A tiny word will be chiseled there, and a symbol. The symbol is a matching guide; it tells you which trio the word belongs to (and has no other meaning). 
+_>'6)
So, stand in ANY doorway in the older stone buildings of Candlekeep and utter the words of a trio in the right order (if you don't know that order, you'll just have to experiment), and you'll be whisked to the corresponding Deep Chamber. Don't worry if you lack  
+_>'7) a lamp; the glowing Footprints Of Return (well, that's what Khelben calls them) will provide enough light to read by.
A Deep Chamber hosted a scene in my Realms short story THE LADY WAS NO UNICORN, written in 1967. (Yes, seven years before D&amp;D first saw the  
+_>'8) light of day.
Except Dave Sutherland, Gary Gygax (who was delighted, and asked if he could steal the idea; I said yes, of course), and anyone at my Dad's workplace who read that early story. (Realmslore, Sword Coast, The Herald, Volo, Waterdeep)

Pedantic This Week [@] [@] I've a question about Gargauth. In terms of lore, he is persona non grata in Baator, having been exiled under threat of extreme pain. Why is it then, he believes that going back to Baator would allow his release from the shield?
I’ve had these very same questions ever since I first heard that Gargauth was trapped in a shield that you could get in Discent into Avernus. I had wondered if he was still a god and had worshippers.
I've been having Gargauth troubles in DiA too. I'm struggling to understand any scenario where being diabolical helps him. It seems to me all his paths to freedom rely on being forthright with the adventurers so he doesn't get ditched in a demiplane or the bottom of the Styx.

Sun Sep 05 15:54:47 (Pages from the Mages, Realmslore, Realmspace)

?_>'Hi [@] , I have a couple of questions regarding spells and spell ink formulas since I was rereading the Pages from the Mages articles in the Dragon.
It seems really expensive to make spell scrolls, like for Read Magic, a 1st lvl spell, it requires a large blue (1) 
+_>'1. Yes, it IS expensive. That’s why most wizards DON’T just spend their lives sitting in an office copying out scrolls and then selling them. They need to go adventuring to get their own ingredients, or get the money to do the basics of making magic. The design #Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) thinking at the time was to present players with meaningful choices, the same as most people face in the real world: your pile of painstakingly-saved money can go towards a house, or buy a new car, or buy all new appliances and clothes and have some $ left  
+_>'3) over; what to choose? But yes, you don’t need to destroy jewelry to get the gem ingredients; as it’s going to end up pulverized into powder anyway, you can use raw, uncut gemstone, fragments of shattered gems, and dust from a jeweler polishing gems. 
+_>'4)
As we saw in SPELLJAMMER, phlogiston is the rainbow-hued, mutable flammable liquid that fills the space between the crystal spheres (Realmspace, Greyspace, etc.) in the Prime Material Plane or to the flammable fluid that permeated it, a rainbow-colored chaotic 
+_>'5) material that surrounded the spheres. Those who spelljam call the phologiston “the Rainbow Ocean: or “the Flow.” In real-world historical alchemy, phlogiston is a mysterious substance that’s in anything combustible; its hidden presence makes the combustible  
+_>'6) material able to ignite, and it’s released as a gas in combustion. So that formula requires phlogiston given off by a fire elemental (in its normal flaming, so no fire elemental has to be “killed” to get it, you just have to have some means of trapping some of 
+_>'7) the air around a fire elemental and then distilling the phlogiston out—yes, that means another step or steps of trapping and distilling, but that’s the whole point: giving a player who’s in-depth roleplaying being a wizard Things To Do). Yes, a dying or  
+_>'8) sorely wounded wounded fire elemental will give off a large amount of phlogiston.
The same spell ink formula are employed for all means of writing scrolls, or even engraving them on metal pages (the grooves must be imbued with the ink), unless magical  
+_>'9) duplication means are used. So yes, to make scrolls, to copy into a spellbook, or from spellbook to spellbook. Which is one reason many older spellbooks are just spell scrolls from different sources, bound together into a book with pages of notes

?_>' [@] The duration of K's Avatar spell in Netheril sourcebook was "unlimited" but in P&amp;P was "limited". The P&amp;P came out later so it replaced the former.
What will be the states of M (didn't sacrifice herself) and K (wasn't destroyed by godly power) after the end of spell? 
+_>'1)
In the Netheril sourcebook, the lore reflected the beliefs of Karsus (or his insane propaganda, if you prefer), whereas the P&amp;P lore reflected the truth so far as it was known.
Canon tells us the fate of Karsus: see
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) [:] for a summary, and that of Mystryl: [:] (reincarnating as Mystra).
Karsus cast the spell, and its expiration doesn’t undo what

+_>'4) damage to magic, or to her, or to the floating Netherese cities). What would have happened to Karsus then would have depended on his actions; if he’d tried to attack Mystryl, she’d likely have ignored him and so let the 
+_>'5) backlash of roiling magic burn out his brain, so Karsus the mindless would have soon perished. If he’d entreated her to undo his folly (unlikely, given his overweening pride and fading sanity), she’d likely have saved him but 
+_>'6) sharply limited his access to the Weave, so he’d have ended up as a minor mage or sage of magic.
If Karsus had never dared to cast the spell, Mystryl would have watched over him, ready to step in (see above) in an instant if 
+_>'7) he did try the steal a god’s power, and he’d likely have gone on to greater and greater acts of tyrannical insanity, rooting his righteousness in the “certain” knowledge that he was “as good as” a god, and could become a god 
+_>'8) whenever he wanted.
But if you’re asking what would have happened if Mystryl hadn’t sacrificed herself, and Karsus had cast the spell and become a god, he would still have been overwhelmed and catatonic, the spell would then

Exeunt Karsus, in any case.

Wed Jul 21 02:45:59 (Moander, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_>' [@] Hi Ed, I was looking at the piety system in the Mythic Odessis of Theros book and I was thinking of implementing something like that into my Realms campaign
If you don't know what it is, it gives the players rewards for advancing their deity's goals. there are 4 (1) 
+_>'1)
Deities in the Realms have always rewarded devout followers. Usually by getting their clergy to do something (practical) for them, or rescuing them from disasters, but also through manifestations (of the god's presence, attention, and power) and bestowed spells.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
This made it into an earlier edition of D&amp;D as the "Imbue With Spell Ability" spell.
In the 'home' Realms campaign, non-clerics, characters of any class, and even non-classed NPCs, could have a spell bestowed upon them, for their immediate use in time of need. 
+_>'3)
This happens in at least two adventures I designed for TSR to run at GenCons at the time FR debuted as a setting. Third-level spells are fine as rewards, and so are much more powerful spells if they're one-shots and what the character needs at that moment. 
+_>'4)
Even sufficiently fervent prayers could receive a response, though bestowals of spells are usually in return for a heroic service.
In short, this has always been in the Realms, for non-clerics. Clergy, often including paladins, don't get this sort of reward as  
+_>'5) they have their own established (through the church) paths of rewards/ascension in priestly ranks and offices and character class powers.
Deities in the Realms have always been about aims. Because I formalized portfolios for D&amp;D, gamers have concentrated on  
+_>'6) what god is "responsible" for what field or genre or topic, and has dominion over it, but the game is predicated on free will over destiny (or adventurers aren't heroes, simply pawns following a divine script), so the deities are "overblown-mortals" or  
+_>'7) super-mortals" (flawed and fallible), so the best way to roleplay divine influences and interventions is to look at what the deities, AS PEOPLE, are striving for, or want and what they allow their mortal followers to strive for, and accomplish (not just  
+_>'8) taboos for the faithful, but secular activities of priesthoods, like investing and sideline industries and politicking). This lets campaign play focus on priesthoods and devout lay worshippers (who receive dream-visions, or orders from priests in temples 
+_>'9) when the lay worshippers show up to pray or give offerings) trying to do specific mundane things in the world, to further what the deity wants to see happen, so instead of passively or reactively "standing for all things to do with cows, or anvils, or sea  
+_>'10) voyages," a deity is pushing mortals and a webwork of caused or exploited events to achieve certain things, usually in conflict with the interests of other deities so the Church of Shar or of Ilmater or of Moander is an active, complex force working on  
+_>'11) many fronts, doing things great and small, in an ongoing, dynamic way.
If that's your jam, of course.
As D&amp;D was born in time when the real-world beliefs of consumers had to be respected from a distance, gingerly, this was one aspect of the original Realms  
+_>'12) that got downplayed or omitted.
So it's great to go this route, if a particular gaming group is comfortable doing so. In short, if the piety rules work for you, great! Third level spells grants are by no means too high. :}

Religious feasts can differ markedly depending on what deity, and the customs adopted and promoted by the clergy (e.g. Silvanus: wild bounty, eaten raw, Chauntea: baked grain goods), but large family get-togethers in the Dales
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) tend to follow this general pattern: huge amounts of food, prepared by many family members and any invited guests (if you’re a guest, you bring something) and with the majority of them being baked savoury pies (think: 
+_>'3) casserole but in a dish and cover made out of thick, durable hard-baked pastry) or stuffed roast fowl or sausages of all flavours or seasoned loaves of bread (i.e. baked with added cheese or strong herbs and spices or 
+_>'4) berries). The “sides” include lots of pickled veggies and preserved fruits. What’s done to make things “special” are to break out exotic, expensive foodstuffs from afar kept in the “precious larder,” to call on aged wine or 
+_>'5) ale or strong drink, and to make really flavourful fresh sauces to slather over everything, especially the pickled and preserved stuff after it’s been rinsed, so its taste will differ from “how it usually tastes when you open

Also, folk in the Dales pride themselves on the cheeses they make, so strong and “different” cheeses will feature prominently.

?_>' [@] The debate was why we know so little about these continents than the planes (if true). I suspect it had more to do with lack of documentation/chronicling than sources of knowledge (like aforementioned people). Or is there other reasons for secrecy/mystery (other than NDAs 😂)? 
+_>' [@] Travel between most continents is difficult (the gate networks are largely forgotten or hidden or controlled) due to harsh terrain and prevailing weather, and long distances. The few who "make it" (e.g. fartraveled merchants) don't want to encourage competition. 
+_>' [@] Add to that the abundance of monsters and sentients who prey on any sort of critters passing by, or who just don't like intruders, and you have travel at a trickle.
And on top of THAT, place this: (control of) knowledge is power. Rulers don't WANT everyone to

And to that, add that communications is and continues to be lousy, with word of mouth from peddlers and other travelers the main news sources. The game gives us a distorted view of ease of

If you equate Low Fantasy as Swords &amp; Sorcery, or "lunchbucket fantasy" or "warriors for the working day" (a la Fafhrd &amp; the Mouser) then that's the Realms, SO LONG AS the Dying Earth is also "Low" in your judgment. Trouble is, LOTR is High Fantasy, and the

All three have ceremonies that follow the overall pattern of: eulogy for the dead, dedication of the dead

+_>'1)
Heh. Yes, I’m still Ed Greenwood; it seems to be my fate. So
If your game is set in the 1490s DR, the Moonstone Mask has been winched closer to earth on its chains to more easily allow workers to (by means of tall, rickety
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) scaffoldings) effect repairs and an expansion of its cellars, incorporating access chutes and doors (for bagged refuse out, helped by gravity, and crated food supplies in, by means of ropes, pulleys, and hooks located in 
+_>'3) the Mask).
After several unfortunate incidents, Liset hired a veteran all-female (but not all-human; the ranks include a half-orc, a gnome, a tabaxi, a loxo, and a thri-kreen) band of far-traveled but aging adventurers 
+_>'4)
Darra’s Debatables, to provide security for the Mask. The leader of the band, Darra One-Eye (she wears an eyepatch to conceal not a missing eye, but a grafted-on monster eye rumored to have some unusual powers, unleashed on 
+_>'5) foes through visible beams of magic), now manages the Mask on a daily basis, but her Debatables keep a low profile, spending much of their time behind spyholes in the Masks’s extensive network of secret passages, bursting 
+_>'6) forth only when needed.
So the typical visitor will find the Mask little changed, still dimly-lit but well-furnished, with many hangings, comfortable overstuffed leather furniture, fur rugs underfoot stretched taut to avoid 
+_>'7) any tripping hazards, with soft spotlights situated to fall on handy decanters, goblets, and trays of bite-sized delights (“larr-bites” [that we would call sausage rolls] chief among them, but bacon-wrapped mushrooms filled 
+_>'8) with sharp eesor [El described it to me as “like mushroom-laced strong cheddar; made by dwarves in Mirabar, and deeper places”] cheese and shrimp delight crunches not far behind). Aside from the rooms patrons rent, there are 
+_>'9) quiet areas” for private converse, the playing of games, and for business conferences, and “joyous corners” for noisier social interactions (revelry). The revelry takes place on the lowest public floors of the Mask, the 
+_>'10) gambling on floors above, and the quiet chambers on floors above that. The rentable bedchambers, by the way, are largely soundproofed (to each other and public passages, not to the labyrinth of servants’ and secret passages 
+_>'11) that separate the rental rooms).
The staff visitors will encounter is still all-female, and they still wear the glowing, moonstone-trimmed (and, yes, magical) masks and the sheer black gowns. They are accompanied by the 
+_>'12) ghosts of several staffers who died in the Mask, who spy on guests and will protect staffers menaced by anyone, but otherwise usually remain silent and invisible (though at least two of them, Mleeset and the half-elf 
+_>'13)
Truulem, have a habit of whispering disconcerting warnings in the ears of guests who are up to mischief, without showing themselves first).
What I’ve written here makes the Mask sound far more dangerous than it typically is 
+_>'14) for most, it’s either a place for flirtation or more, or a carefree party-moot—or just a haven to get a safe, quiet sleep or rest in the heart of Neverwinter without being disturbed by anyone, except as you arrange to be 
+_>'15) disturbed (with, say, breakfast in bed) before retiring.
By the way, the latest popular dessert offered in the Mask is “warm-suth” (crème brûlée, just as we know it, introduced to Liset by Elminster, shortly after his foray 
+_>'16) into some local restaurants that followed a visit to my Toronto home).

?_>' [@] [@] My point isn't the existence of money, and I'm certainly not going to argue about coin vs. barter in the realms where they're clearly minting coins, but the surprisingly modern idea of wages. 
?_>' [@] [@] As I understand it the Lords of Waterdeep are traditional inherited aristocracy, not mercantile princes, and so aren't actually required to pay anyone. That they invest in the local economy by paying their staff rather than simply extracting taxation is remarkably farsighted. 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] It's interesting but 'farsighted' might be a stretch. Aristocracy is rooted in feudalism but isn't wholly dependent on it. Ancient Athens had slavery but if they escaped to Sparta, say, they were free. 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] The existence of a merchant class implies economic choice. Unless they were outright legal slaves, a staff member could always take their chances working in the private sector. Thus the Waterdeep Lords needed to compete in order to be served. 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] Generally not. A feudal lord owned the property his people lived on, the tools they used, and usually the facilities that fine goods were made through licensing. Guilds were chartered and those guilds empowered franchisees. Homesteaders or self-starters were extremely rare. 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] One of the reasons I continually and patiently tell folks that I have never based the Realms directly or closely on any real-world history or culture is because of misunderstandings like this.
Waterdeep has never been feudal, and real-world feudalism is about

Mon Mar 29 13:28:05 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_>' [@] I have a question about how you run dragons. So looking at the DM's Sourcebook to the Realms (1E Gray Box), it mentions that FR dragons are significantly stronger than those presented in the 1E MM, like having twice the number of attacks (up to 6) and a stronger (1) 
+_>'1)
Heh. The short answer, in the Realms, is almost always: it depends.
On the dragon, that is.
They are strong-willed, vain individuals, and very much Do Things Their Own Way.
Most of "my" dragons had long-standing spell defenses (2e: guards and wards, later 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) editions, legendary actions/lairs) in place around them, traps, and "hanging" spells (cast but not unleashed, hanging fire until the right moment, which is when they need them against an intruder. Most dragons don't like to fight in their lairs (too confined) 
+_>'3) and try to take the battle outside in a hurry, where they can take to the skies and launch flyby and pounce attacks, or even trigger (pre-prepared) avalanches and collapses, or unleash caged monsters on intruders. Fiction (Hollywood and small-screen

?_>' [@] I have two small questions about the city of Waterdeep for you on my birthday:
Did the noble houses Anteos and Phull pay to be the namesakes of those streets next to their villas?
If so, why is the leftmost road named Brassfeather Lane instead of Brossfeather? [:] 
+_>'1)
No, the Palace is very firm against attempts by nobles and guilds to influence street names. The "people" decide, often overriding formal names with their preferences. In this case, they decided on Anteos and Phull (the noble families were delighted).
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2)
The Brossfeathers deliberately chose to buy and build nigh Brassfeather Lane, because of its (pre-existing) name.
It's named for a famous-in-his-day long-dead smith and metals caster, the gnome Huldeth Brossfeather, whose home and workshop once fronted on it.

Yes, both by race/species and regionally. Dwarves and gnomes count along knuckles, left hand being "ones" and right hand "tens." Halflings count around bases of fingers on inside palm, tapping the center of the palm with the thumb of the base hand for every ten.
Realmslore [:]

Elves count with raised forefingers and then make a cupping, sweeping motion of the left hand for every subtotal, adding the right hand in a crossing motion (cupping right palm to back of left hand) for a final total/result. I put some description of that into

Many human merchants have two ways of counting: cupped-palm-hidden for private transactions, and slow/broad/showy for public totalling.

Sure. In Torilian Elvish, “nys” = sister, “arael” = heart, and “ever” is both “home” and “of the”
So “sister of the heart” is Nyseverarael.

Marangar (this is like cabbage in its looks and structure, but tastes like semi-sweet mango if left raw, layers torn apart for eating, but more like cornbread if torn apart and the

?_>' [@] So the alignment chart in turn can only really apply to singular characters, not a civilization or a society as a whole. 
+_>' [@] Exactly.
Many elves would reject the very notion of other races judging them, but as with humans, dwarves, and others, individual elves who travel more, and have more contact with other races and places, tend to have broader views (more tolerance).
Halflings who  
+_>' [@] live in human-dominated cities are among the most flexible and tolerant, particularly if they live in cosmopolitan cities (like the ports of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate) and see many different folk, from many lands.
I've always seen alignments as a baseline for  
+_>' [@] determining the "usual prevailing views/attitudes" of a group (e.g. race or army), but even then, the lived experience of "this particular" group will largely determine their views. (If you're always raided by orcs, you'll see orcs negatively. If they aid you, no).

I'm tired from my annual stress echo, but okay, just suffering through the 2 weeks of wearing a Holter heart monitor that gets in the way of everything.
Every tower along the city walls has three beacon-fires laid ready for lighting (if a beacon has to be kept 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) alight a long time, the unlit two get cannibalized as fuel for the lit one, as more firewood is brought up from storerooms below in the tower), but "torchtowers" is the collective name for wall-towers that aren't also city gates or major "moot-towers" where  
+_>'3) walls meet. So any "just another tower" along the wall is a torchtower. (Every walltower contains dungeon cells, a Watch "ready room," locked storage rooms for evidence/confiscated items retention, some bedchambers and garderobes, and a tiny armory.)

+_>' [@] The specific answer, for elves, is that their sentience (intellect and memories) survives. What becomes of it again depends on circumstances; they are usually reincarnated, but may be trapped in a magic item or something else (though non-reincarnation is rare).

?_>' [@] A question about information flow in the realms. Say an archaeologist makes a major discovery—a ruined city, a lost temple, ancient annals of a lost kingdom—that is worthy of sharing. Assuming they wanted to, how would they relay their discovery to the wider world? 
+_>'1)
There are "broadsheets" (newspapers) in many major cities, but the main channels of information have always been traveling merchants, from large caravans to lone peddlers with a trio of mules, who trade news, rumors, and the latest jests for drinks from bored 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) locals when they stop over at an inn or take an upstairs room at a tavern for an evening. Within cities, there are always "gossip grapevines." So that's how news spreads.
With news of the sorts you list, a discoverer will likely want to NOT relay their  
+_>'3) discovery to the wider world for fear of the city, temple, or annals getting seized/occupied/plundered by the fastest, greediest listener who can muster swords and muscle.
So what most often happens in these situations is: the discoverer seeks a wealthy  
+_>'4) patron to sponsor an expedition, knowing there will be a price. If they don't know of a suitable one, and aren't part of a guild or fellowship that could aid them in explorations (such as the Society of Stalwart Adventurers), they often write a chapbook for  
+_>'5) public sale and distribution that conceals/misdirects re. the location of the find, seeds JUST enough true lore that sages with an interest in the field/topic will get VERY interested, and await offers from possible sponsors. Whom they then try to find out all 
+_>'6) about, in a hurry.
Often while less than savoury "other interests" who have read the chapbook try to find THEM, and apply persuasion.
Ah, life is an adventure. Try to maintain the ability to flee fast.

?_>'The sub plots as you mention or the one-shot adventures; in various villages, cities and landmarks all across the peninsula are all turning out well. 
?_>' .However sir, the main plot "meld" is not quite there. The reason i write all of this is because of one of your first points you mentioned in Chapter 15 is "having purpose" 
?_>'And I am a huge "have purpose or offer purpose" type of DM. In fact, for years before reading chapter 15, I was told by some of my players that is exactly why they don't mind playing at my D&amp;D table. 
?_>' .To shorten up my babble sir: it just feels like the bad guy is simply a more powerful threat. ..or each sublot has its own depth and is captivating .each area of exploration is well thought out 
?_>' but in the end its like the sorcerer in the castle and his legion are the "uberdragon" as you mention in this chapter. Overall its good. Looking at each individual 3 hour adventure is great. 
?_>'But holistically, the bad guy seems to have 1 direct uber-plan and i struggle with it because its well ..bland in some cases.

Why not have the big bad guy know he has some sort of secret inner sickness (cancer?) that's eating at him?

In Volo's Guide to Cormyr you detail the "gunpowder wand," a (possibly Lantan) two-shot handgun. I've always seen you advocate smokepowder, so is this name a misnomer?

Gondites know about gunpowder (the saltpeter, etc. mix) but Gond cast a mighty magic to stop it from igniting swiftly (it burns with a flame, not exploding). Gond RARELY grants magics let gunpowder be used, but never enough to threaten smokepowder's dominance.

?_>'Hi [@] is there anything you can share about the use of treacle in the realms? In cooking, magic, or what it's made of? Thanks in advance! 
+_>'1)
Sure. In our world, treacle is unrefined sugar syrup, commonly called “molasses” if it’s dark (opaque brown), and “golden syrup” or some variant of that if it’s light (translucent and golden).
In the Realms, “treacle” means
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2) just the dark stuff, as the lighter variety is called various things including, yep, “golden syrup.” In the Realms as in our world, this light syrup finds its way into tarts and sponge puddings (treacle tart and treacle 
+_>'3) sponge pudding are classic British desserts).
In our real world, molasses finds its way into oatmeal for those who can’t get maple syrup, into pies like pecan pie, into bread like pumpernickel, and into sauces (BBQ sauce) 
+_>'4) into meat marinades, into rum, into gingerbread cookies, and into baked beans.
If I was writing that same sentence about the Realms, I’d say: treacle finds its way into oatmeal for those who can’t get maple syrup, into pies 
+_>'5) like nutbrown tarts, into bread like darkloaf, and into firefruit meat sauces and marinades, into rum and darkfire slake, into ginger biscuits, and bean-barrel-sauce (some eat it with the beans, and some wash it off

Yes. The entity is and has always been Fraz-Urb-Luu, pronounced “FRAWZ-urbb-loo,” but some scribes recopying ancient writings in Thorass were confused by the script (the difference between a lowercase “L” within a word or name

Later scribes, trying to prevent introduction of errors, clung to whatever source they were copying from (copying out by hand being the only way to hand down writings, before

I meant: a wizard studies a spell (peruses its glyphs while memorizing its incantation and casting procedure) to put it in his/her mind, but a cleric prays to a deity in order to be "given" a spell (the deity "imparts"/places it in the cleric's mind).

Did Karsus of Netheril (the momentary god) have any siblings or family?
Thanks for your awesome world! 
+_>' [@] At the time of his momentary godhood, Karsus had only one surviving kinsman: a nephew, Raent. Who detested everything his uncle did, and was.
Raent was an arcanist with his own "wild talents" (i.e. a sorcerer as well as a mage). And disappeared, likely deliberately.

Some expire without warning, some create a rising whistle in the caster's inner ear, and some begin to tint vision a warning rose-red near expiry.

?_>'The Realms have smoke powder, not gunpowder (See [:]). And it's a very restricted substance that hasn't made it into general use that would permit giant cannon platforms like frigates. FR is a Renaissance-era world. These ships are just too modern to fit. 
?_>'Canonically, gunpowder doesn't combust in the Realms, as per [@] So you've got smokepowder that's super hard to come by. [:] 
?_>' [@] [@] One could ask what about rare or unique propellants such as Cordite, which was used in early Lee Enfield ammo
Admittedly though. the ruling was clearly meant to prevent silly shenanigans like someone smuggling a rifle from our plane back into Forgotten Realms, in general  
?_>' [@] [@] Omg. Lee Enfield? We're up to cartridges now? ;-)
That's my concern. When you start advancing tech in a setting, it starts having an impact on the entire world. Could a 12th-century Norman keep stand against a broadside from a frigate? Not a chance. So the setting changes. 
?_>' [@] [@] I mean you could just ignore the implications of it like World of Warcraft. It's a fun strategy, but I like Imix putting his flaming foot down and saying "uh-uh." That keeps the setting heroic D&amp;D fantasy for FR is renowned for. 
?_>' [@] [@] Precisely my point. It's a classic medieval fantasy and the whole point of the story about Gond altering the world's chemistry so that gunpowder as we know it wouldn't work is to keep it that way, regardless what crafty artificer players might attempt. Wrong setting for that :) 
?_>' [@] [@] Total agree! So instead of a frigate, that ship should be a cog, galleon, or maybe a caravel. [:]

I'd penned a short story in which a wizard used a spell to fix the broken joints of 9 men after a battle; it became "ninemen" and (alliteration's artful aid) got hitched to the spell. I was 6 at the time, and D&amp;D was still a decade away.

Harlent Gauntyl (NE hm Rog14): blond, green-eyed, burly and very handsome, Harlent plays the “idle young noble who likes revelry, drink, and ladies” but this is just a role he acts. Behind this mask, Harlent is a man who 
+_>'2) enjoys the embraces of just about any creature, and lives for the fun of swindling and deceiving those he despises (most folk), with fellow clever beings. He doesn’t mind if someone out-swindles him, the game of avoiding 
+_>'3) taxes and fencing stolen goods and besting others in business deals is its own reward. Being clever, and thinking up new ways of manipulating others, are what drives and truly delights him. He’s an accomplished “con man 
+_>'4) and has recently started working with senior agents of the Xanathar, for mutual benefit. He knows the crime lord is using him, and doesn’t mind in the slightest, as its interests, backing, and longer “many covert agents 
+_>'5) reach enables him to pull off greater and greater cons. He loves fine wine and snails (the latter for eating, racing, and keeping as pets; he even has some that devour human flesh, which comes in handy for tortures and body 
+_>'6) disposals on some rare occasions, though he prefers to avoid killings; they take time that could be used for the fun of more manipulations). He tries new foods and diversions with an eye to their utility as manipulative tools.

Tanther Urmbrusk (CE hm Ftr9): a good-natured, easygoing, well liked and fairly good looking “friend to all” who is a joiner of fellowships, clubs, and causes, always up for a new entertainment (way of wasting time, from a 
+_>'2) card or party game to a risky sport like sneaking aboard ships by night to climb their rigging and leave rude trophies on mast tops. He’s notorious as a player of pranks, which betimes go wrong or even cause fatalities but

+_>'4) of the family with his “too-friendly frivolities.”) Tanther likes a party, has a large and veteran capacity for drink, a strong stomach for all manner of food clashing in it, great stamina (he can roister for days and nights 
+_>'5) on end and not grow weary or even yawn, though when he crashes, he’s out like a light and snoring heavily for long periods, if left uninterrupted), and is skilled and enthusiastic when it comes to the ladies.

+_>'RPG Match - connecting TTRPG players [@] do you have a homegame list of 15th century Waterdhavian nobles you can share? #realmslore #waterdeep
Ed Greenwood [@] been looking for the "big" list this last week, but [that] may take months. 
+_>'1)
However, I have a much shorter list of the young rapscallions and poseurs who're giving the Deep trouble circa 1497-99 DR.
Here we go:
DEPLOYABLE YOUNG NOBLES OF THE DEEP IN THE 1490S DR
These are all young ‘players’ among the nobles; restless ‘doers’ who 
+_>'2) habitually step outside their family compounds and the ranks of fellow nobility to truck with merchants, adventurers, and shady sorts. They are inquisitive, interested in new things and innovations and “what’s different,” and are apt to get mixed up in  
+_>'3) intrigues that go beyond who gets to dance with whom at the next revel, and who was most clever in their cutting rudeness to someone else at the last feast.
So here we have: 
+_>'4)
Three roisterers: a prank-player (Tanther Urmbrusk), a deadly “don’t get in my way, I slay” sort (Srandor Sultlue), and a merry, jovial drunkard (Rarantorn Argent)
A nasty “I get more than even” investor and manipulator (Anthaud Agundar) 
+_>'5)
An ambitious, “I want influence and a leading society reputation” social climber (Sameira Kothont)
A handsome intriguer, who’s both a con man and in cahoots with the Xanathar (Harlent Gauntyl) 
+_>'6)
A rival intriguer who works with monsters in Skullport, adventurers, and shady merchants/smugglers (Vrantavvar Ruldegost) 
+_>'7)
And 
A high-society nice young airhead who’s really a skilled actress playing that role, and behind closed doors is an accomplished, capable envoy (Dzarlantra Tesper) 
+_>'A1)
Anthaud Agundar (NE hm Rog11): a dark-haired, dark-blue-eyed, short, slender, quiet man of tight lips and usually stone-faced-blank expression, who is ruled by greed tempered with patience. In life, he must get ever richer 
+_>'A2) but can take short-term losses and small gambles if he has to—so long as someone else is to blame, in his mind, and can be made to pay (often with their life, but he’ll settle for any city real estate they own, or other 
+_>'A3) worldly goods if he must; if they have nothing, he’ll try to have them kidnapped and sold to slavers; he knows some covert “takers” in Scornubel). Anthaud’s a superb actor who can convincingly feign fear, confusion, naivety 
+_>'A4) and drunkenness—but if he’s awake, he’s hawk-alert and calculating, always coldly calculating. He tries to avoid personal combat, preferring to let hired swords do his dirty work or to lure pursuers into deadly traps he’s 
+_>'A5) arranged. He carries a small personal arsenal of family-made weapons that don’t look like weapons, many of them poisoned, and is an energetic investor and manipulator, who calls on his mentor, his uncle Hamnaer, to help him 
+_>'A6) get more than even against anyone. A nasty man. 
+_>'And details of the others will follow, as I squeeze them in around everything else (Andrew Valkauskas and I are bringing to life an entire fantasy CITY, AthCliath, for his #FateOfTheNorns game, and I think it really IS alive by now!)

Rarantorn Argent (CG hm Ftr9): a merry, jovial and dashingly handsome epitome of the gifted, popular young noble, always prominent in news and gossip. A roisterer and a drunkard who doesn’t often get disparaged as a heavy 
+_>'2) imbiber as he’s a natural athlete with superb balance and coordination, so can deftly catch, throw, aim himself, and successfully attempt intricate intercepts of moving objects even when slurred with drink (unlike most folk 
+_>'3) he doesn’t stumble or reel, just blacks out and collapses when he’s really overdone it). Naturally friendly to all rather than being haughty or adverse to associating with strangers, the grubby, or non-humans, he has friends 
+_>'4) and contacts all across the Deep, high and low, and makes more all the time—as he’s fun-loving, generous, and likes to aid others and has the knack of not offending them by how he gives that assistance. He loves informal 
+_>'5) celebrations, flirting, and lighthearted fun, will try to invite or draw servants and onlookers into it, and thinks that’s really what life is for. An unambitious drifter who deals with adventurers for the fun.

+_>'1)
Vrantavvar Ruldegost (NE hm Rog6/Ftr4): House Ruldegost is a popular noble family in Waterdeep, with many and varied interests and successes, and a wide variety of living members. They all bear the shining mantle of the 
+_>'2) far-traveled gallant adventurers, sponsors of adventurers, and very successful merchants of the last seventy years, including the nigh-legendary seacaptains Urtharl Ruldegost and Tansheira Ruldegost, “She-Wolf of the Seas 
+_>'3)
Ranthar and Tulvin and Lasheira Ruldegost are all popular, socially-busy, energetic younger Ruldegosts, but their younger brother Vrantavvar (like his namesake uncle, who long ago retired to Scornubel and has been a focus of 
+_>'4) disquieting rumors of monster-breeding and worse, in his declining years) is a quieter, more private person, with iron-strong control of his facial expressions and voice. The younger Vrantavvar was introduced to certain drugs 
+_>'5) by his uncle as a young boy, and has both enjoyed their effects and built up a near-immunity to them, so his uncle started dosing him with poisons so he’d become nigh-immune to them, too—with, Elminster informed the Harpers 
+_>'6) great success.
The elder Vrantavvar did this because he wanted a young, vigorous sidekick to assist him in his smuggling activities to and from Skullport, and the younger Vrantavvar took to it like a natural, making much more 
+_>'7) extensive contacts in Skullport than his uncle ever did. Including quite a few “monsters,” with whom he works frequently on activities “of mutual benefit” (a favourite phrase of the younger Vrantavvar).
Over the last decade 
+_>'8) the young Vrantavvar Ruldegost has built an empire of trading connections between various folk of Skullport and shady merchants of Waterdeep—and calmly fended off repeated attempts by the Xanathar’s agents to eliminate him 
+_>'9) or take over this or that strand of his trading network. Vrantavvar’s own agents of choice as go-betweens and to thwart the Xanathar’s agents are hired bands of adventurers who came from outside the city, and are seeking 
+_>'10) hirings or their fortune in the Deep. He provides steady employment for many, and in return they have pruned so many branches of the Xanathar’s network that the crime lord sent Vrantavvar a formal, explicit “I’m going to 
+_>'11) leave you alone now, please stop” message. Which Vrantavvar was quite happy to do; he much prefers to spend his time making everyone illicitly richer. He hates paying taxes, has no qualms about trading with beings who eat 
+_>'12) humans, and thrives on the thrills he gets from the dangers involved. He’s also become incredibly personally rich—so much so that he’s buying city real estate in Baldur’s Gate, Athkatla, and now in Cormyrean and Sembian 
+_>'13) cities, and hiring distant agents in such places to act as his landlords and reinvest the rents in their own sideline businesses (he doesn’t care if they cheat him, he’s already made more than he can ever spend in his life). 
+_>'14)
He’s toying with the idea of toppling any local rulers who cross him or harass his agents or trading partners with converging bands of anonymously-hired adventurers.

+_>'1)
Srandor Sultlue (CE hm Rog12): is an urbane, outwardly pleasant person who inwardly keeps constant score in life, calmly and cold-bloodedly; he has to best everyone he meets (over time, not necessarily within every deal 
+_>'2) conversation, or encounter), unless he exempts them (as he does his own kin). If you seriously impede his wants and doings, he arranges your death (preferably dealt to you in person, but he’ll employ agents or arranged 
+_>'3) accidents” if he’s busy with more pressing matters (or foes he respects more). Deadly with a blade, he won’t hesitate to slay anyone if he thinks he can avoid blame and consequences, and will make very sure of kills 
+_>'4) (beheadings or repeated impalings trump a single stabbing thrust) and enjoy doing it. His other pleasures include gambling (he must win, so cheating is fine), “wenching” (seduction and sex that preferably involves inflicting 
+_>'5) pain; he most enjoys this when partners seem to enjoy receiving it), and revelry. Srandor is a notorious roisterer who often still goes from revel to revel to feast to club to tavern, until past dawn. His stamina never flags.

?_>' [@] Thank you so, so much! I appreciate your amazing insights and I appreciate you taking your time to craft such a detailed response! 
+_>' [@] Oh, I forgot to mention that the sky-blue wine "avanal" (taste: a little like a dry Riesling made tart with cranberry juice) is THE drink of choice in Halruaa. Served chilled, in chilled fluted tallglasses, but NOT served with ice. 
+_>' [@] A popular Halruaan snack: a glass or two of avanal served with a small oval platter of nutbread crescents (crescent-shaped cookies; nutbread is like a very dark, rum-and-cherries-and-dark-chocolate Christmas cake; the nuts are pecans, walnuts, and pistachios).

?_>' [@] Thank you so much, I'll look through there as well, this is exactly what I was looking for. 
+_>' [@] If you find Polynesian real-world analog stuff, that's fan-invented, not the Realms.
Tharsult is something of a refuge/base for wealthy traders, including dealers in spices and salts. Semi-precious carved stone statuettes were once its most popular local currency. 
+_>' [@] Tharsult has always presented itself as safe "neutral ground" for merchants to parley and make deals in, and their mansion vaults have always offered money and valuables 'safe storage' services, for fees.
Cliff shorelines, not good harbours, so little pirate trouble.
