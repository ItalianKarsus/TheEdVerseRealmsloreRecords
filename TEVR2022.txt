Thu Mar 10 02:15:43 (Mielikki, Realmslore, Silverymoon, the Realms)

?_> [@] Good Morning Mr. Greenwood! If you were to take a young maiden on a date in Silverymoon, what are the places to see? Any specific alehouse, romantic sites to sit and talk, or any activities you'd recommend to a young couple in love in the Gem of the North? 
+_>1)
Silverymoon is one of the most romantic large cities in the Realms, remarkably free of the stinks and din of most places of its size, and it offers almost every experience, to couples or to lone visitors in search of diversions. Here are just a few: 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Tart Making
If the thought of making pastries together under the kind guidance of an expert appeals, hie thee to Dauntar’s on the Ghostwalk [see the “7” on that map? The small, almost-square beige building north and west of the numeral] for sweet confections 
+_>3) and the Bloodlily Bell on Dancer’s Mask Lane [see the “2” on the map? Go SE to the first curvingly-triangular city block you see, and look along its south curving edge for a gray building between two beige ones, the W beige being almost square and the E one  
+_>4) being a long rectangle; the gray building is the Bell] for savory tarts. Of course you can eat as you make; it’s expected! Only 1 sp for a bell (about an hour) of making and sampling, or 4 sp if you want to take away not just what’s in your hands, but a big  
+_>5) wrapped bundle of what looks nicest.
Drink Making
Or perhaps you’d prefer to make your own strong-drink beverages together, mixing liqueurs or sherries with various fruits, herbs, sugars, milks, and foams. For this, try either Brantaleir’s Bower on Bowshot  
+_>6)
Ride [see 21 and 22 on the map? Go west to the Ride, which runs down the other side of the city block bracketed by the numerals 21 and 22, the Ride being the street that runs S from 6 to the river, and look for a thin grey rectangular building about halfway  
+_>7) down the W side of the block/E side of the Ride, that has a stand of trees behind/E of it] or the Maiden’s Kiss on Brightbuckler Street [two streets fork at 21, and Brightbuckler is the eastern one, that runs to the docks without encountering 22 or 23; go S  
+_>8) along it to halfway down the block bracketed by the fork, to a small beige building on the W side of Brightbuckler, that has a stand of trees right behind/W of it].
Brantaleir’s is known for a pineapple and cherry almond drink known as Phandara’s Fine Fancy  
+_>9) (request a Firefancy if you want it strong), and the specialty at the Maiden’s Kiss is the Mintkissed Murarra (a lime-infused eggnog).
And that's the first fifth or so of my lore answer. Duty calls (I must feed my wife) now, but will return with more, later.} 
+_>10)
And I'm back!
Tastings
You can attend tastings at scores of places across Silverymoon, but the most romantic, with some privacy, quiet music performed by minstrels softly singing and playing several rooms away, and low candlelight, are at Shantarra’s on the  
+_>11)
Moonway [back to 21 and 22 on the map, go down the Moonway to just a shade S of halfway between those two numbers, and look for the smallest dark building on the W side; it’s the third building N of 22], and feature chocolates topped before your eyes with  
+_>12) your choice of warmed sugar-and-fruit foams or spiced custards. Truly, sweet enough for the gods!
Sights
If oddities and off-beat curios (such as the crowns of several lost and fallen kingdoms, a “Crawling illithid brain” in a jar, the famous Panties of  
+_>13)
Feather Falling worn by Lady Steel while dragonriding into battle during the Weeping War and earlier, and the floating fingernail of the lich Haraunhree, graven with runes none can read, that glow with curses that will be unleashed if those runes are ever  
+_>14) touched) seem like fun things to view together, head to one of Silverymoon’s curated trophy collections, like Thulvur’s Remembrances on the Moonway [the backwards-C-shaped building on the E side of the street, the second building N of the Mulgate, which is 29]. 
+_>15)
Or try your hand at painting, alongside accomplished artists who’ll be happy to show you how they draw faces, or capture perspective, or mix pigments to attain particular hues, in Omthra’s Pleasure, a wine- and refreshment-serving art studio on Many Cats Lane  
+_>16) [see the 6 on the map? Go N across the street to a small gray square building, and then head east two buildings, to a small square beige building on the N side of Many Cats Lane, that’s also the fourth building west of the very big, many-winged gray building  
+_>17) near 8 on the map]. You can just have fun and walk away, for free, or pay a gold dragon and have your daub finished expertly, framed, and treated so its colours will last and resist sun, water, and many spills, then delivered to any address in Silverymoon. 
+_>18)
Dancing
If dancing together seems attractive, there are many venues in Silverymoon, but four stand to the fore. First, Tathtantra’s on the Moonway [E side, the dark brown rectangular building W of 30 that fronts on the Moonway] if you’d like private instruction  
+_>19) on how to dance (appropriate music and lighting provided).
Seek instead Halacantur’s Revelhaven on Many Cats Lane [S side, the rectangular beige building immediately below/S of the “33” numerals] if it’s raucous jigs and ramballions you prefer, in a  
+_>20) crowded, jovially noisy, upbeat setting of many dancers having fun together.
Or the formal and expensive House of Charaunsea on Dancer’s Mask Lane [W side, four buildings S of Many Cats Lane: the brown square building 2 buildings N of the beige building right 
+_>21) beside the “3” numeral on the map] if your preference is for slow and sad and formal dances, on an uncrowded floor.
And don’t miss Envelaer’s on Bowshot Ride [W side, two doors down from Helmer’s Wall: that is, the brown rectangular building that’s the  
+_>22) second building S of the pair of buildings marked “6” on the map] if your preference is for slow and intimate, with discreet minstrels behind tapestries, and low lighting, in a sequence of seven linked rooms of olden design. Avid readers may want to avoid  
+_>23)
Envelaer’s unless they don’t mind being distracted by books they catch sight of, on the shelves they’re dancing past.
Park Visits
At dawn, for a bell, and at dusk and for three bells after, Mielikki’s Glade [31 on the map] is open to the public for private  
+_>24) prayer, contemplation, quiet discussion, and “being one with each other and nature.” The best of Silverymoon’s parks for curated but “unspoiled” nature, the Grove is hushed and yet melodious, due to spells cast by its guardians that quell city noises but  
+_>25) provide rustling-leaves and trickling-stream sounds brought magically from the Unicorn Run. Mielikki’s will encourages birds and small wildlife to come and to roam, but their natural caution means bitings and other close encounters are rare 
+_>26)
If you’d prefer a more private “park” visit, go to Qalantavvur’s on Dancer’s Mask Lane [the gray L-shaped building on the N side of the street, in the same curving triangular block where the Bloodlily Bell can be found: 4 doors east of the Bell] to experience a  
+_>27) park inside a building: a large mansion has been remodelled into a sequence of private rooms (“bowers”) along a winding path that have openings that are rose-red if occupied, and emerald green if vacant. Magic provides concealing and sound-deadening mists at  
+_>28) every entrance, and each room has a discreet curtained-off corner garderobe and has been sculpted into the semblance of a wilderness clearing, or grotto, or the interior of a huge hollow tree, or a vine-girt hollow. Choose your spot to linger. 
+_>29) (The ground floor “park” is open to the paying public, but the upper floors (meeting and dining rooms, lounges and short-stay bedchambers, are for club members only; Qalantavvur’s is an expensive-annual-dues, and so, exclusive club.)
Much more to come, later.}

Wed Nov 09 04:15:28 (Realmslore, Tethyr, the Realms)

?_> [@] Hail, Goodman Greenwood!
Tis Election Tuesday (no, not a holiday) here in the USA, and I think we'd all love to learn something about popular electoral systems of the Realms. What are some offices elected 'by the people'? How does the system work?
Cheers! 
+_>Hi! Really busy with design work tonight, but let me say a few words about local elections for “village lord” (mayor) and harbormasters (in ports) in Amn and Tethyr. In the smaller places where they are elected, as opposed to appointed (in the larger places, it’s 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) often a “reward posting” for investors handed out by local nobles or wealthy and powerful locals).
Voters in such elections are stakeholders: property owners in a settlement, or owners of docks and warehouses and shipyards in ports. They go before a local  
+_>3) herald (with a local priest as a witness, if there’s a shrine, temple, or monastic community locally; if more than one deity is locally represented, each will have a representative) to vote verbally (out of earshot of others) for their chosen candidate (any  
+_>4) local resident can stand), and for each vote, a pebble is put into a jar labeled for that candidate, and all jars are safeguarded by the herald and the clergy (often in a secure structure to minimize tampering). When the election time is deemed over (it may  
+_>5) be as long as a tenday, but by local custom is usually three or four days, dawn to dusk), the pebbles are counted by the herald and all clergy in unison, and the high total wins. If there’s any dispute or anomaly (more pebbles than local voters, for  
+_>6) example), a new election is held, but any incumbent running again does NOT stay in office until it’s done; rather, clergy step in to serve.

Make sure you peel your onions before eating them while pregnant or your child might be born a lindworm.
I'm really curious if this has any bearing [@]  
+_> [@] You'd have to ask the designers who originally introduced them to the D&D game, well before TSR bought the Realms.
Zeb Cook had them in the 1981 Dwellers In The Forbidden City (set in Greyhawk). I had serpent people in the Realms in 1966, drawing on many pulp sources. 
+_> [@] Mine were more like R.E. Howard's serpent folk in his King Kull stories (though many early folklore writers had similar creatures before REH), but the lindworm of old Scandinavian mythology entered D&D and the Realms as the linnorms (Dragon 182).

Sat Jan 29 17:09:04 (City of Splendors, Realmslore, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian, the Deep)

?_> [@] Hey Ed, the question came up recently and I checked the numbers. In City of Splendors there was a map according to which Waterdeep is ~5,7 mi² (~14,8 km²). Yet it has like 1,3 Million citizens. I live in Hamburg, Germany with 1,8 Million citizens on 755,09 km 
?_> [@] Population density is usually higher in Europe then in the US. But, ahh where do all these Waterdhavians live? Or is the City bigger then previously imagined? 
+_> [@] Most Waterdhavians live in rented rooms above shops (often 3 or 4 floors). Density is high. But see the FRCS: population of the city proper is 132,661, but Waterdeep has an "official" pop of 1,347,800, due to the Deep-ruled farmlands around the city (40 miles out). 
+_> [@] Folk with means and lifestyle to do so often relocate south for the winter months (so population totals dip). The "comfortable" built capacity of the city proper is likely around 225,000 (meaning, housing stock could hold that many without rebuilding/expansion).

?_> [@] what's going on at Warlock's Crypt these days? 1492DR Someone was asking this question in a Realms based Facebook Group today. #Realmslore 
+_>1)
Some of what’s going on is NDA, I’m afraid, but two important ongoing processes are complex, long-term, many-layered (spell upon spell upon spell) castings by the liches who obey Larloch, following his standing orders
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) (“If I am absent for this amount of time, begin casting X”).
The first casting is a complex defense-in-depth series of wards that augment the usual wards, and involve sixteen ‘bound’ death tyrants, and eight bound dracoliches. 
+_>3)
The second casting is a series of spells that will begin to covertly take over the minds of particular wizards all over Toril, including a zulkir of Thay, a member of the Twisted Rune, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood 
+_>4) several senior Zhentarim, a Cult of the Dragon mage, and so on, so they will do the bidding of their Warlock’s Crypt “controllers” (in most cases, without even realizing it).
There’s no confusion, consternation, defiance, or 
+_>5) power struggle going on in the Crypt. To the liches therein, Larloch is simply off on one of his longer jaunts, doing things he hasn’t told them about. The lich Aumhrathond is Acting Castellan of the Crypt. 
+_>6)
Since the end of the Second Sundering, the liches of the Crypt have successfully bred certain “new” (crossbreed) monsters, that I’ll tell you more about some other time. ;}

Tue Apr 05 15:18:52 (Blackstaff, Mirt, Realmslore, Waterdeep, the Deep)

?_>Is it safe to assume that an embassy in a big city like Waterdeep would have a permanent teleportation circle to go back to whatever country they’re from? [@] #dnd 
+_>1)
No. Such would not be allowed, for security reasons. Khelben trusted no one but himself, and made changes to Ahghairon's wards. (The original wards have been augmented and modified many times over the years.)
From 1342 DR onwards to the present, you can't 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) teleport into or out of Waterdeep by means of spells or items, with one exception. You can teleport and dimension door (and use other translocation spells) WITHIN the wards (i.e. from place to place within the city), but you can't pass through the wards UNLESS 
+_>3) you access one of the invisible, secret-location valves/doors through the wards. These are controlled by the Blackstaff (with three backup individuals, identities secret, but I'll whisper to you right now that Mirt is one of them, and that all of these backups 
+_>4) only know how to access one to three of these secret valves, not the rest of them). If you're trying to use a spell to teleport into or out of the Deep, you need to speak the correct phrase for one of the valves, adding it to your usual incantation. If you do 
+_>5) so correctly, your spell will work flawlessly, your teleport passing through the valve no matter where it is (i.e. if you're standing in Dock Ward and want to teleport to the Rat Hills, but know of a valve on the beach in northern Sea Ward, your "jump" will  
+_>6) loop back through that portal to get to the Rat Hills, despite the change of direction). There is a "master" incantation that opens all the valves, and there are both items and passive wardstones (aka ward tokens/pass tokens; see my VOLO'S GUIDES) that allow  
+_>7) automatic" passage through the wards (i.e. without the bearer needing an incantation or even knowledge of the valve), but there is NO WAY an embassy would be furnished with this.
Just glance at the plots of published Realms novels that use Waterdeep as an  
+_>8) in-story location; most don't make sense if anyone (or an army!) can just step through a teleportation circle.

+_>1)
Coverage is slight because this almost always has to roleplayed out (unless it's history/backstory). If a community doesn't feel safe with a low-level evil spellcaster in their midst, they'll drive that person out of the community. Most living beings need to 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) sleep and spellcasters need to study/concentrate to regain most spells and to experiment with new ones, so community harassment CAN drive such a person away (they're already foes). If the community doesn't want to do this personally, they may hire adventurers  
+_>3) (such as the PCs) to do it. This is one reason why evil spellcasters often try to hide their true natures or seek seclusion (dwelling out of town, in a place they can trap or defend or equip with "pet" monsters). 
+_>4)
In the "home" Realms campaign, such beings usually AREN'T imprisoned: they're sentenced to do a service (task) involving travel (often with a geas or more powerful cleric/local arms of a faith oversight to make sure they keep at it) that will keep them busy for  
+_>5) a time AND give them some personal benefit (and likely some new personal foes/rivals) to further occupy their time. Lessening their inclination and time to harass the community in future.
Many sentences in the Realms are fines (if you can't pay, you may flee 
+_>6) so the community exiles you without formally doing so) or tasks (so the community gets a benefit rather than just an expense [incarceration]), as opposed to imprisonment.

Fri Mar 11 01:21:55 (High Forest, Realmslore, Silverymoon, Sundabar)

+_>46)
And now, the conclusion 
Kata Strophie [@] you were to take a young maiden on a date in Silverymoon, what are the places to see? Any specific alehouse, romantic sites to sit and talk, or any activities you'd recommend to a young couple in love in the Gem 
+_>47) of the North?
Clubs and Eateries
Silverymoon offers scores of clubs for intimate meetings, romantic and otherwise (not to mention brothels), and almost a hundred places to dine, but to mention just those catering specifically to romance and romantic  
+_>48) opportunities, we have:
Dining on warm cheese melts or chocolate-dipped strawberries by a fireside at Jacer’s (an upstairs establishment owned and frequented by faerie dragons, located above Amuldro’s Fine Vintages, a high-end wineshop, on Many Cats Lane  
+_>49) [N side, square brown building 5 doors west of where the Lane meets the Market, and 5 doors east of the brown rectangular building immediately above/N of the “8” numeral on the map]).
Or partake of oysters from the water-caverns of Sundabar, and fine roasted  
+_>50) fowl drenched in gravies by Roevuroaskur of Everlund, all accompanied by a wide selection of light wines or heavier sherries, at Malammaskur’s Board on Bowshot Ride [the brown NE building on the E side of the Ride, on the corner of the Ride’s moot with the  
+_>51) first cross-street south of Helmer’s Wall].
If your shared tastes are more adventurous, try roasted forest fern beetles from the High Forest (much more appetizing than they sound, especially when paired with mint jellies) at The Green Table on Many Cats Lane  
+_>52) [N side, the small rectangular building immediately E/next to the building that the arrow accompanying “33” cuts across]. Living trees adorn the dining area, and their special desserts (flavoured cream foams floated atop fruit juices) are a must! 
+_>53)
Or visit one of the many fine eateries that serve fresh Rauvin river trout. The most romantic ambience among these fish-houses is likely to be found at Suusannarra’s Fine Fins on Brightbuckler Street [the last/farthest S building on the W side: the almost-square 
+_>54) beige building that’s the third building going due E from the “22” numerals on the map].
Or relax together at Xundarra’s Thirsty Throat on Many Cats Lane [the brown rectangular building on the N side of the Lane, S of the “4” numeral, 4 doors W of the  
+_>55) distinctive zigzag large gray building, and 3 doors E of the NE corner of the moot of Many Cats Lane and the eastern arc of Dancer’s Mask Lane], a rooftop wine bar crowning the abode of Xundarra the Reformed, a lamia who makes her living as a hairdresser and

If getting giggly and tipsy together isn’t your aim, Silverymoon also  
+_>57) offers taethurns (tea rooms), and perhaps the oldest, quaintest, most fern-bedecked and private of these, where discreet and knowing servers won’t interrupt tender moments, is Gulvaer’s Gargoyles on Rallowglass Ride [the beige rectangular building on the W  
+_>58) side of the Ride, four doors N of its moot with Dancer’s Mask Lane, and 6 doors S of its moot with Many Cats Lane].
Opportunities
And to end our possibilities for a romantic date in Silverymoon, think of these more unusual undertakings: 
+_>59)
Enjoy a starwatch cruise aboard an open boat, drifting down the Rauvin by night. Three rival boats are careful to keep well out of each other’s way, but the most romantic of them, in both furnishings and service, is undoubtedly the Rauvinshadow, that berths at 
+_>60)
Tresker’s Mooring [the large almost-square building on the N bank of the Rauvin that has two wharves jutting out from its foundations, the first jetties west of the one that anchors the Moonbridge] west of the foot of Bowshot Ride (three trips on a good  
+_>61) night, weather permitting).
Take part in a wine-revel in a private mansion: the House of Harlanchalur on Dancer’s Mask Lane [W side, the last/northernmost building before the city wall, fronting on the eastern end of the Lane], which has its own  
+_>62) catacombs” (labyrinthine wine cellar, now equipped with beds and couches, lamps that can be shuttered, and privacy draperies). Dustra Harlanchalur is a bald-shaven Thayan who has tattoos and red robes, but swears she’s no Red Wizard, and lacks the Gift  
+_>63) entirely—and she’s been tested by, and attested by, no less than High Mage Taern Hornblade, to prove it. If shy folk need guidance in the physical arts of pleasure, Dustra is happy to give it, but some folk fear her, saying her large dark eyes “lure you in  
+_>64) and drink your soul
Expensive but worth it: take a magical “just your body moving through the air, clad as you will” flight, out over the Rauvin, to waft far enough away from the lights of the city to enjoy the stars; you can fly or cavort or dance or  
+_>65) even make love in midair, under the stars, all at the behest of Launtra Tampranna the Mage, who can be found at her riverside home, Jessilcloaks [the building just east of The Bright Blade Brandished, #1 on the map].
And there we have it: a quick overview  
+_>66) of places to go and things to do in Silverymoon for a romantic couple wanting to enjoy each other’s company.
May you all have as much fun, or more, in the Gem of the North!

Fri Jan 07 18:06:48 (Realmslore, Toril, the Realms, the Weave)

?_> [@] 
Hi there! I am about to DM a new campaign for my group, and I had a question about FR magic: if a Giftless wizard from a world where an innate Gift is not necessary to learn magic (only study and effort) arrived in Toril, would they still be able to use their powers? 
+_>1)
The Gift" is merely the name given in the Realms for the ability to wield arcane magic (some folks can carry a tune and others can't, some are tone-deaf and others have perfect pitch). So if your wizard from another world has been casting spells in that world
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) they obviously possess the gift.
The question is not if they have the Gift or not (they do), but HOW the spells they've been casting (by study and effort) work. Almost all wizards in the Realms call on the Weave, as their means of drawing on natural energies  
+_>3) (wind, wave, tidal, kinetic, etc.) to power the effects that their incantations shape and specify.
The wizard from another world may be working spells that don't call on the Weave, or that call on it in ways that will produce surprising-to-them effects (e.g 
+_>4) a Wand of Wonder). They may have to experiment for a bit (and these experiments may be dangerous or even fatal) until they learn what "works" in the Realms. Some of their spells may not work at all (nothing happens), and some may go "wild."
This has happened  
+_>5) to many individuals in the past. Quite a few have stopped casting magic out of fear, and taken other professions. 
+_>6)
The reason the term "the Gift" exists at all is as a handy way for saying if someone can cast arcane spells, but the precise term was coined by priests of various deities wanting to convey the impression that the gods bestow this ability (they can, using the  
+_>7)
Imbue With Spell Ability spell, but it may or may not be church propaganda to assert that being born able to cast spells is always a "god-given" ability).
And when I say that "This has happened to many individuals in the past" I mean that I was writing and  
+_>8) publishing Realms short stories establishing this phenomenon in the setting before the game of D&D existed. The D&D game has added more examples of "magic not working the way you're used to" when you enter other planes or alternate Prime Material Planes.

?_> [@] Thank you very much, comrade! But now I'm wondering: does Loudwater cut through a hillside or something for the natural grottoes to exist?

No. Loudwater stands at the confluence of the Delimbiyr and Greyflow rivers, and in the highest spring floods (during years of heavy snows, and so, the largest melts), water runs everywhere. Including into the soft limestone of Standing Stone Hill and other local
Realmslore [:]

The old Waterdhavian joke is that there is indeed, and it’s called Piergeiron’s Palace.

Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) here’s what I can tell you from memory:
Halvan was a greedy and ruthless man of the sort who’s jovial to friends and supporters, but regards anyone who crosses him or stands against him a foe. So he made many enemies, and his determination to plunder the fabled  
+_>3) riches of Myth Drannor (despite visits from elves who warned him not to) earned him his grave.
Halvan saw forests of the Elven Court as “raw wilderness to be tamed” for enrichment. His grand plan was to eventually found a caravan-road cutting through the  
+_>4) deep woods to Cormyr (and so, the Sword Coast) so that Harrowdale would get all the overland trade and rise to outstrip all the Dales and even Sembia, becoming the funnel through which all the metals mined around the Moonsea would flow west. As he grew older 
+_>5) his patience waned as his fury against the hurdles the world threw up before him waxed, and his belly grew larger. So did his paranoia, causing him to start to hoard and hide wealth (earlier in life, he spent it on ostentatious displays, like his famous  
+_>6) gem-encrusted and gold-plated armor); legend and truth both say most of his hiding places were close to home (“under his eye”), and a lot of them were within hollow walls and in secret rooms and crawlspaces in his Keep.
Halvan’s Keep was really an old manor  
+_>7) house and stables and several root cellars and a springhouse (shed built over a spring to keep it from freezing over in winter, and free of tainted refuse year-round) that he expanded and had a stone curtain wall built around—a thirty-foot-high miniature  
+_>8) version of a “grand castle wall” with towers along it. There was no real central “keep” or fortified tower, just a three-storey-plus-attic stone house with many chimneys and wings, surrounded by the wall enclosing the outbuildings and a small kitchen garden. 
+_>9)
It's now a monster-infested ruin, with parts of the roof fallen in and several rooms burnt out in fires, much visited by adventurers over the years trying to find Halvan’s treasure. Small bands of brigands often squat in these ruins and murder arriving  
+_>10) adventurers, or set up traps to do the slaying for them—and every so often illithids or doppelgangers or kenku come along and “harvest” these brigands (but don’t stay to become the next victims).
At the time when Doust Sulwood was lord in Shadowdale, some of  
+_>11) the elves he befriended told him the elves could have put a stop to all this, but had decided to leave the ruins of Halvan’s Keep as an active, everpresent reminder of the danger and foolishness of despoiling the forests. They and some roving Harpers checked  
+_>12) on the ruins from time to time, but only clashed with residents if they saw extensive woodcutting or fire-setting.

Can you tell me some interesting information about the Deity Mask that many might not know?

Mask enjoys his own company more than that of anyone else; what we call “loneliness” is his preferred emotion. In himself, he values sublety above all else; the scheming and plotting to manipulate entities and events so deftly
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) that no one notices they’re being manipulated. He hates Cyric above all, and delights in stealing small amounts of Cyric’s power and influence back to himself.
Mask can shift shape from any humanoid form to any sort of mask 
+_>3) including rectangles of gauzy cloth without shaping or eyeholes (the sort of mask that’s just tied around the head, and the material peered through). He prefers to do this, slumping into seemingly-discarded cloth litter 
+_>4) underfoot, to avoid detection. These mask forms can fly, flitting like moths or butterflies by choice but sometimes flapping like bats. Mask’s chief hobby is eavesdropping and listening. He can perfectly mimic any voice he’s 
+_>5) recently heard, and often murmurs words into ears that other entities mistake for someone else they’ve been speaking with. He’ll often do this to speak on behalf of someone who’s died, so others think they’re still alive.

+_>Jon Forel [@]  what do you recommend, in terms of spells and magical effects, for a 5e DM running something during the height of the Netherese Empire? Same question, but for the elves' Crown Wars? 
+_>1)
Big questions, so one at a time. Netherese Empire first.
When encountering an arcanist from an unfamiliar city, feel free as a DM to use ANY spell, from any source (and class) as a spell cast by that arcanist, if it fits/helps 
+_>2) the unfolding story. ANYTHING goes as a spell effect (within reason, of course; an arcanist is not going to waste a high-level slot on a spell to change the hue of flowers). Spell-mantles aren’t a popular thing, but personal 
+_>3) wards that counter a specific sort of damage with a pre-prepared spell response are.
And finally: get out your Wand of Wonder tables, both official and any favourites from among the many, many magazine article and homebrew 
+_>4) alternatives. Use them when hostile spells collide in spell-duels, and 2 table results (or pick what best fits the situation) when 3 or more spells collide/overlap areas of effect.
Many arcanists are real eccentrics, obsessed with odd details; play them that way. 
+_>5)
Crown Wars time: although there are a few haughty mavericks in every force/side fighting in the Crown Wars, MOST forces are disciplined; like a modern real-world football team, they discuss and practise tactics, and are 
+_>6) trained to carry out roles (personal assignments) every spellcaster is expected to do in a given situation/in response to a particular battle cry. Particular forces favour the use of particular spells and schools of magic 
+_>7) (again, equivalent to a modern football team specializing in the run, or deep passes, or play action), and will rarely have spells ready to cast that “step outside” their favourites.
And lastly, elves of that time are VERY 
+_>8) big on etiquette and honour, and will “play by the formal rules of war” which include not attacking children or non-combatants, NO despoiling the land (e.g. “scorched earth”) or poisoning anyone or anything no matter what 
+_>9) the stakes, and no alliances with goblinkin (orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, etc.) under any circumstances. Sneak attacks, thefts of crops and other supplies, and the like are considered low, unfair, and mean; if you fight dirty 
+_>10) you have already lost in your own eyes, in the eyes of your kin and allies, and in the eyes of your foe. The end does NOT justify the means.

Wed Sep 28 00:54:58 (Realmslore)

+_>Bruno William [@] 
Ed, could you tell us about Mystran wedding ceremonies ? It would mean a lot to me and my character who is soon to marry. 
+_>1)
Sure!
Mystran wedding ceremonies tend to be short and simple (more complicated for me to clearly describe than to do).
If one or both participants (NOT a third party) can work flying or levitation magics, it’s customary to 
+_>2) rise into the air in an embrace (and kiss) once vows are said. However, this is an optional “touch of grace,” not a requirement.
In a Mystran wedding, a mage or priest of Mystra (or failing that, an elder person trusted by 
+_>3) both of the individuals to be married, who has personally prepared The Ring) officiates, and the individuals to be married are both escorted to them, separately, by someone they love and trust (often a parent, but may be kin 
+_>4) or a friend). There’s usually an audience (or at least a witness).
The officiator greets the audience: “In the name of Mystra, be welcome,” and strikes a handbell or gong (deeper tone preferred to higher) to begin the ceremony. 
+_>5)
This is the signal to the escorts, who bring the individuals (who begin at locations out of sight of each other) to be married to the ring (ideally from different directions). Customarily the couple-to-be wear finery they like 
+_>6) (of any style of dress).
The Ring is a circle on the floor or ground, large enough for the officiator and the individuals to be wed to stand in together, that is defined by seven blue-white stars, with two gaps left in the 
+_>7) ring that can be filled by two additional stars. Usually, these nine stars are flat paper symbols of royal blue stars bordered in white (a wizard or priest of Mystra would use magic to cast star-like floating, glowing 
+_>8) three-dimensional images); see the symbol of Mystra illo on the Mystra page at the FR Wiki.
If the officiator stands at the 12 o’clock position within The Ring, and the audience is ranged from the 4 through 8 o’clock 
+_>9) positions, the gaps where stars are missing would be at the 4 and 8 positions.
The escort leads the person to be wed. The escort carries a light source (conjured handfire, candle, lantern, or even a flashlight aimed upwards) 
+_>10) and the person to be wed carries a star of Mystra.
When the escort reaches The Ring, they stop just before “their” gap, extinguish their light source, and step aside and back (to join the audience). The person to be wed 
+_>11) advances to stand in the gap, and the officiator greets them: “In the name of Mystra, be welcome
They respond by saying, “In the name of Mystra.” Then they step through the gap, turn, and place their star in the gap, to 
+_>12) complete The Ring (of nine stars).
The individuals to be wed can do this in unison, or one after the other, whatever they and the officiator prefer or circumstances such as time of arrival cause (who goes first or if they do 
+_>13) it simultaneously has no significance).
The two individuals then approach to stand on either side of the officiator, facing each other. The officiator asks them, “Do you wish to become one?” 
+_>14)
The customary response is “I do. WE do.” (Again, it can be delivered in unison or succession, and the choice and who goes first doesn’t matter.)
The officiator then announces, “Before Mystra, these two desire to become one 
+_>15)
One of the individuals (it doesn’t matter who goes first, though if there is a difference in ages, it’s customarily the older person) then says to the other, “I am [they give their name as they prefer to style it, but surname 
+_>16) included], and I give myself to you.” And they kiss their own fingertips and extend their self-kissed hand, palm out and upright.
The other person to be wed does the same, and then they both step forward until their

+_>18) joined hands, and says, “The blessing of Mystra, Our Lady of Mysteries, be upon this union. Laugh together, and work magic together, and be greater thereby
The officiator then removes their hand and steps back out of 
+_>19)
The Ring, whereupon the couple embrace and kiss.
The officiator and the escorts then intone, “Mystra witness!” and the escorts step forward to remove all of the stars, working from audience side around to the back, and give 
+_>20) them to the officiator, so The Ring is no more—and the ceremony is ended, and the mingling and chatter usually starts.
If done at night, and it’s safe and practical to do so, the stars may be replaced by candles in bowls or 
+_>21) braziers on chains, or other open vessels that can be comfortably and safely carried. However, these must remain lit throughout the ceremony, or it must be redone, so beware high winds and low fuel.
If an exchange of rings is 
+_>22) desired (it’s optional), these are customarily worn by one half of the couple to be on one of the fingers they kiss, then touched together when they put their hands together, and then they begin their embrace as a couple by 
+_>23) exchanging (donning each other’s) rings.
Music is entirely optional, but if used, is traditionally played just to accompany the escorted approach of the participants (which is usually unhurried), and after The Ring is taken 
+_>24) up and the ceremony is ended.

?_> [@] What would it take to start a war between Baldur's Gate and Amn in the late 15th century?
Sarevok nearly succeeded with the Iron Crisis but a lot has changed since then. Are tensions still high enough for a credible plot?

My judgment would be that both places are too concerned with making coin and dealing with local troubles/problems for an "overall war." But both places would look the other way if merchants or merchant cabals started "unofficial wars" with elements "in the other

Fri Jan 07 03:03:02 (Athkatla, Berdusk, Border Kingdoms, Cormyr, Harper, Realmslore, Scornubel, Secomber, Sembia, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian, the Realms)

?_>Good evening again, Saer [@] , I come once more with humble Waterdhavian inquiries.
Did we ever discover the fate of the siblings Rayland and Talandra Roaringhorn in the IDW comic series? 
+_>1)
Discover it with me now. ;}
Rayland was as good at intrigues as his father and uncle, and more handsome and dashing than both put together. He had three lovers, and children with each, before marrying and having four children.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
First, he shared a bed with Sharrandra Drethen, a wealthy young woman from Amn who was then in Scornubel; she bore a daughter, Saeril, a quiet genius, mimic, and superb actress who is VERY good at deceptions and intrigues 
+_>3) and is now richer than her mother, thanks to her mercantile tactics in Athkatla. Rayland’s firstborn, and they know each other and are fast friends rather than “father to daughter
Then Rayland spent some years with 
+_>4)
Lharauva Hethenwood, a ranger and Harper from Berdusk. She bore him a second daughter, Teiraskeira (“TEER-ask-keera”), who was a wild-spirited, fiery-tempered “tomboy” type from birth, and is an emerald-eyed and flame-haired 
+_>5) adventurer faring far across the inner Heartlands, having left both her parents behind but not in anger.
Then Rayland settled in Silverymoon and consorted with the half-elf Imbeirimra (“Imm-beer-IMM-rah”) Shalantwynter, and 
+_>6) they had a daughter Eirel (“EAR-ell”) who is a serene painter, sculptor, seamstress (making much of her coin creating beautiful gowns that fetch high prices in Silverymoon) and harpist (harpist, not Harper). Rayland and 
+_>7)
Imbeirimra drifted apart, as he’d done with both of his previous lovers, but he seems to have the knack for parting on good terms with women, and without dispute or bitterness he left Imbeirimra amd Silverymoon and spent some 
+_>8) time with the Roaringhorns in Cormyr, seeing the Dales (which he liked, as “beautiful backlands”) and Sembia (which he hated, as “crass and brash and haughty with nothing behind it but coin, or pretense of coin”) ere coming 
+_>9) to an agreement with the Cormyrean Roaringhorns to set himself up as a wayhouse and trader for them in Secomber, “within hail of Waterdeep without being under the eye and shadow of his father,” as he put it. There he met an 
+_>10) older, plainer woman, a limping retired adventurer with sharper wits than his own, and was smitten
It took a year or two of wooing before commoner Semmera Lathdale agreed to wed him, but their union has been strong and 
+_>11) happy: she rules the roost, he does as she directs and they wax richer thereby because she has thrice the head for business than most nobles, and they dwell in a grand house in Secomber and quietly own over thirty more 
+_>12) thanks to shrewd purchases by Semmera, some of them “safehouses” and others always rented out. Over a decade, Rayland and Semmera have had two daughters followed by two sons; from eldest to youngest, these are: Phandele 
+_>13)
Tammur, Ornatar, and Revrel. The last three are too young to be married (by Heartlands customs), but all of Rayland’s other children are quite old enough to both have offspring and to be wed. 
+_>14)
Which brings us to Talandra, last seen in the Border Kingdoms. She has not wed, but has taken many lovers, most human (at least one elf and two half-elves) and mainly male (one of the half-elves and several humans have been 
+_>15) female). Like Rayland, she has a knack for parting on good terms with lovers, though she has a far hotter temper than he does—and she’s shown no signs of getting pregnant no matter what she does.
Interestingly, Talandra 
+_>16) encountered (in Derlusk) a quiet, studious woman who claimed to be Taevra Roaringhorn, a younger sister she never knew about. Taevra is a scribe and bookbinder and sage-in-training, and looks so like a slenderer version of 
+_>17)
Talandra that she believes they’re blood-kin, though she has no idea how their parents kept her existence secret—or even if she’s a half-sister, perhaps the result of her father taking a secret lover. .and Taevra hasn’t said. 
+_>18)
Many noble families in the Realms have this sort of web of scattered legitimate and bastard kin spread across Faerûn and beyond. I have pages of informal notes, prepared back when “the Young Dragons” were writing their 
+_>19) first books in the Realms, and there were plans for series involving nobles; I was going to gift them each a family to play with, and watch the fun. ;}

Mon May 23 20:27:39 (Cormaeril, Cormyr, High Road, Immersea, Realmslore, Sembia, Spellplague, Suzail, Volo, Westgate)

?_>Putting up the interactive map of Immersea with pins. [@] was the city your original? or created for Grubb/Novak novels? Also, do you happen to have street names and any other places not on published maps for Immersea? (haven't checked Volo's yet) [:] 
+_>1)
Okay, work done, took me a few minutes to update to the 1400s. Here we go 
Immersea is not and never has been a city, BTW. (Some local merchants like to speak of it as a city when they’re elsewhere, trading, to make it seem larger and more important than it is.)
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Streets of Immersea:
Calantar’s Way: the main overland highway passing through Immersea. It winds down the eastern side of the map from near the NE corner to about a third of the way west from the SE corner of the map, along the map’s bottom edge. 
+_>3)
Starwater Road: begins in a T-junction with Calantar’s Way in “The Hard” (hardpacked open dirt-and-gravel loading and unloading and boat and net storage area) just west of the docks, and runs west across the map and off it, heading into the King’s Forest. 
+_>4)
Immer Lane: begins in a T-junction with Calantar’s Way (the second such junction N of the moot of Starwater Road and Calantar’s Way) and parallels the Starwater Road, forming the high street (main street) of Immersea as it does so, before it curves SW and  
+_>5) crosses over the Starwater Road to climb Spring Hill in a spiral, and end at the source (rising, but long ago protected by the townsfolk by building a well-roof and stone cladding around it) of the Immer Stream.
Redstone Lane: begins in a T-junction with  
+_>6)
Calantar’s Way at the S edge of “built-up” Immersea, and runs between the twin lion-statue-roofed gatehouses NW to the gates of Redstone Castle, branching SW to access its yard; N to the pumphouse (nigh the Immer Stream); and W off that N branch to run past  
+_>7) the granary, stables, and carriage shed.
Dathur’s Lane: begins in a T-junction with Calantar’s Way between Redstone Lane and the Immer Stream, and hooks NW to access a stables (former barn, W side on the banks of the stream) and three homes. 
+_>8)
Dathur Mahalrym was a long-ago Purple Dragon officer who retired to Immersea and became a local builder; he lived in the largest of those three homes, and owned the barn, but died back in 1326 DR. There are still Mahalryms in Immersea, Yeoman Bridge, and along  
+_>9) the Immer Shore (S shore of the Wyvernwater E of Immersea, along the Blister Trail) today.
Halahanthra’s Ride: begins in a T-junction with Calantar’s Way between the Starwater Road and Immer Lane, runs W and then curves N and then NW, crossing Immer Lane  
+_>10) and running to a dead end at the Hethcanter farm (Imra Danae, who owned it in the 1300s DR and was the last Danae daughter, married Baerim Hethcanter; the current matriarch is Ildra Hethcanter, her great-granddaughter).
Halahanthra Dree was a local heroine  
+_>11) of the late 1200s DR, a Purple Dragon officer who left the army with the blessing of the Crown after she refused the advances of several nobles in succession, who were angered and made life in service alongside them difficult. Always good with a sword and  
+_>12) in the saddle, Halahanthra became a noted boar-hunter and an adventurer for hire, and often settled disputes in Immersea when folk didn’t want to involve the local lord or Purple Dragon garrison.
The Moonride: begins in a T-junction with Halahanthra’s Ride  
+_>13) and runs west to a fork, the N leg becoming a dead-end at Lluth’s farm, and the W leg ending at what was the “mansion” of Embrar Narnuth (a local trader in the 1300s, who built a grand house that was oversized so he could store wares he’d imported but not  
+_>14) yet sold; he called it a mansion but some locals called it “Embrar’s Barn”); after his death, it passed through several owners and got rebuilt into its current incarnation: the smithy and home of Ambaerand Tansreth (blacksmith who’s good enough to make  
+_>15) sturdy but not decorative armor and swords).
It got its name for two Lluth sisters (who died of old age in the early 1300s) who were werehorses; on bright moonlit nights, to “get out the kinks and aches” of farming, they would take turns riding each other 
+_>16) at full gallop, along this street, which until then had been known merely as “the Back Lane
Bowshot Lane: easternmost of the two short cross-streets linking the Moonride with Immer Lane. Named for the activities of Ansurl Felthorn, an archer in the Purple 
+_>17)
Dragons back in the reign of King Duar dwelt in a now-vanished steading (cottage) at the N end of this lane, and often loosed shafts down it at a target on the side of his brother’s coach, parked at the S end outside Beldred Felthorn’s steading (also gone  
+_>18) now; the area is much more built-up today). There are no Felthorns left in Immersea now, but there are plenty in Gladehap.
Lhantaravur’s Lane: westernmost of the two short cross-streets linking the Moonride with Immer Lane. Named for Inskeld Lhantaravur, a  
+_>19) handsome and popular-with-the-ladies local alchemist who came from Turmish and lived in Immersea in the mid 1300s. At one point he had six lovers on the go at once, four local, a merchant’s wife in Arabel and a young noblewoman of Suzail; they all knew of  
+_>20) each other and didn’t seem to mind. Lhantaravur was very good at painkilling quaffs and at perfumes, grew very wealthy and was kept busy supplying passing merchants who’d buy all of both he could make, and ended up hiring five adventuring bands full time  
+_>21) to be his ingredient-gatherers all over Cormyr, the Dales, and upcountry Sembia. Local lore is that Lhantaravur died of overwork in the end, and that he was a friend of the Crown, visited by the Princess Alusair whenever she passed through Immersea. 
+_>22)
Woodwove Lane: runs S off the Starwater Road at the W edge of built-up Immersea, right into a stand of trees. It’s where the locals cut wood and square and dress it into timbers (and “the leavings” into firewood), and is an ever-longer dead-end as woodcutting  
+_>23) extends it deeper and deeper into the Launth Woods, formerly an arm of the King’s Forest.
The Woodwoves are the family of local woodcutters who own the N end of the Launth Woods, and live therein. Baerit and Chuntan are the unmarried brothers who currently  
+_>24) head the family (surrounded by plenty of younger married nieces and nephews).
Ambrel Lane: runs E off Calantar’s Way between Dathur’s Lane and the Immer Stream, to end in a gravel coach-circle in front of the Immersea Stables (Korvon Dzulas died in the  
+_>25) chaos of the Spellplague, and today the Stables is run by the Taskaunt family, who dwell in the grand home immediately S of the Lane. Ambrel Taskaunt was a self-made merchant from Suzail who retired to Immersea when rivals from Westgate hired toughs to take  
+_>26) take his life one too many times, and he decided that horsebreeding and wagon-fleet owning were better ways to spend his time. It was the best decision he made; in Immersea, he made even more coin, and the Taskaunts became what they are today: a respected 
+_>27) wealthy leading local family who own property and small local businesses all over Cormyr, transport farm produce from eastern Cormyr to city buyers in Suzail, Marsember, and Daerlun, and are heavily involved in settling and developing westernmost Cormyr  
+_>28) (along the High Road west of the Stormhorns).
Harbittur Lane: begins at the moot of Calantar’s Way and the Starwater Road, and runs SE across Immer Stream into the Cormaeril lands.
Harbittur was an early Cormaeril, an affable, strong, large man of  
+_>29) legendary appetites and energy, who expanded his family martial and farming skills into becoming expert stonemasons and builders who owned several small local quarries. He cut and laid down the huge flagstones that underpave most of Immersea’s gravel or  
+_>30) cobble streets, and most of these still survive more than a century after his death (of heartstop, while laughing over his sixteenth goblet of wine, at a family feast in his eighty-ninth year).
Harbittur Lane is the best-surfaced road in Immersea, and is  
+_>31) lined with tall lamp-posts; when the Cormaerils are in the mood (or when fogs off the Wyvernwater are particularly bad and they’re expecting guests), they use pulleys to raise oil-lamp cages to the tops of these, to light the entire length of Harbittur  
+_>32)
Lane from its stone arch bridge over the Immer up the hill to the gates of High Towers.
Chulsanth’s Lane: sometimes locally called “Fishstink Street,” thanks to fishermen tossing rotting fishheads and fins along it as they leave the docks, this runs NE off  
+_>33)
Calantar’s Way, paralleling the banks of the Wyvernwater, to a dead-end at what used to be the town smithy, but is now Carra Chulsanth’s Carriageworks (still a smithy, but that’s only part of a larger wagonmaking shop). Carra Chulsanth hails from Marsember  
+_>34) by way of Suzail, and is a lively-tongued, energetic, darkly beautiful middle-aged woman who makes closed coaches, open carriages, and goods and farm wagons for all, employing over forty local folk to do so
She pays well and has become well-liked, though  
+_>35) she had a rough beginning in local society because of her “I want my own way, and I’ll have it!” ambitions and fearless dominance of situations and disputes. Her conveyances are considered study and dependable and first-rate, and many are grateful to her  
+_>36) for providing loaner vehicles and doing all-hours repairs when needs arise—and personally heading the crews that travel to do so. She’s a hands-on, “help me” boss, not a “sit and count coin with hands never dirtied by work” owner. 
+_>37)
Map Notes: The Immer Trail and Blister Trail don’t appear on the Immersea map; they’re JUST off its edge, to the N and S respectively. The lanes running off Calantar’s Way in the NE corner of the map are nameless, as they’re the entrances to local farms and  
+_>38) run nowhere else.
And there you have it. Enjoy, I hope!

?_>Hi [@] , do children go to school in Waterdeep?  realmslore #waterdeep 
+_>1)
Depends on the child. If they’re attached to a temple, yes, there are classes. For almost everyone else, there are tutors: nobles usually have them on staff, wealthy wannabe-nobles hire them in for a few hours every second or
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) third day or so, and the children of guild members attend guild-sponsored tutor sessions, usually at the headquarters of the guild. However, as one moves down the scale of wealth, the chances for instruction at anything more 
+_>3) than practical job skills dwindle, except for what family members and close family friends can pass on, sometimes in return for a meal. Someone who does well at such practical jobs may well end up apprenticed to an artisan or 
+_>4) crafter, and receive secondary instruction (that is, tutelage in matters not directly related to the work they’re apprenticed to learn how to do) as an apprentice.
There’s one important exception to this: children in whom the 
+_>5)
Gift (the innate ability to wield the Art/magic) is detected young. They get instruction, because the Lords of Waterdeep, the nobles, and the guilds all agree that wizards should be educated, so as to have morals and see 
+_>6) consequences, not just instructed on how to hurl spells around.

?_>Hey, [@] ! Any tips or secret lore you could share with me for a campaign starting at 10th level in Daggerdale, involving the Lord of Daggerdale's lost sister, werewolves, Malar, Loviatar, and Tethyamar?:) 
+_>1)
Heh. Florin secretly rescued Silver Morn years back, so she's not to be found in Daggerdale. (The Zhents lording it in her castle died in the rescue.)
Loviatar worshippers are, though, mainly in the settlements. In the countryside, you'll find a lot of 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Malarites, running "holy hunts" which is a good thing for the farmers still hanging on, as those hunts keep the foraging goblins, orcs, hobgoblins and prowling spiders roaming from the Spiderhaunt Wood down to a (somewhat) survivable level. Driders and some 
+_>3) drow explorative warbands occasionally enter the dale, but have never established any lasting presence because dwarven adventurers seeking to repopulate Tethyamar come up from under the Desertsmouth Mountains to eliminate drow whenever they find them. 
+_>4)
What little hope and aid the folk of Daggerdale receive comes from Shadowdale (preferential prices on needed daily goods) and, surprisingly, from the Zhentarim rebuilding Zhentil Keep, who seek to make Daggerdale their "breadbasket" food source. They have spies  
+_>5) not only among the folk living in the settlements of Daggerdale (including some smiths, carpenters, and roofers) but roaming the countryside--and these roamers include some shapeshifters of various sorts (one or two might be werewolves, but most werewolves  
+_>6) encountered in Daggerdale are likely long-resident in the dale, or have settled there from elsewhere (such as the Hullack region of Cormyr).
The worship of Loviatar is covertly financed by the Zhents, who see it as a way to ultimately controlling the  
+_>7) settlements of Daggerdale from within. Adding spice to this mix are the spies in the dale supported by Shadowdale, and the spies in the dale who are visiting Harpers. ;}
Daggerdale remains an uneasy mix of farms, abandoned farms that nature is seeking to  
+_>8) reclaim (so hunting is good), and ready violence as all of these elements clash. (The elves in the forested areas to the east prevent drow, dwarves, and Zhents from expanding in that direction, so Daggerdale is something of a cauldron.)

Sure!
Dwarven cuisine in the Realms varies widely with what’s locally available, but there are some common staples: leek bread (dwarves make them in handloaves, which are “rolls” to us); potato and leek soup; rock crab; rothé back (bison steak would be close)
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) fried browncap mushrooms (portabello is close); barleycakes (oatcakes); fried lamb kidneys; mutton chops; silverfin (trout); smallfowl sausage (made with minced pheasant, grouse, goose, duck); roast boar fritters (apples, diced dates, flour, salt, thin-sliced  
+_>3) roast boar); and tarnsar (sliced fried potatoes, onions, and boar thinslice).
Hope this helps!

?_>Sexy! What a great product [@] [:] 
+_>And thank you [@] for tweeting this closeup of the cover, because it gives me a dandy opportunity to share a little more about the scene: [:] 
+_>1)
In the scene on our cover, Britt Martin brings us a tense trade negotiation in the street foyer of a merchant cabal’s office in the Thayan city of Eltabbar—dickering so exacting that the dates and wine are running out, and evening is drawing down. 
+_>2)
From left to right, around a table on which trading maps of regions in Chessenta are spread out, we see Bezunthyn Phrul, a Red Wizard senior in years but of middling rank, “standing witness” to all that’s said, but impassively saying nothing. 
+_>3)
Next to him, the half-elven merchant Shelmazra Hornwyntur, Thayan born and an influential and rising member of the Ang Harrad merchant cabal, leans forward to point out where the first shipments should go, and by which route. 
+_>4)
Beside her, the aging Ang Harrad merchant Albrynd Mrethem (once the able right hand of Ang Harrad herself, before her sudden and suspicious demise), keeps an intent eye on a skull floating nigh the shoulder of the chief Red Wizard negotiator, trying to gauge the  
+_>5) lich’s reactions to what’s being said.
He’s trying to do so because as everyone in the chamber knows, the skull is that of the Red Wizard lich Hauzrym, often sent to watch and listen for Szass Tam himself. If the ruler of Thay is taking a personal interest in  
+_>6)
Ang Harrad dealings, the Ang Harrad cabal may soon find itself used in some dark plan.
Also intent on anything the skull might say, as well as Hornwyntur’s plans, is the young Red Wizard Lazurmrella Hlaree, who’s led the negotiations on behalf of the Red  
+_>7)
Wizards. Who are seeking to limit what the Ang Harrad ships, and to have everyone they ship it to clearly identified, so such outlander contacts can be measured for usefulness and what influence may be brought to bear on them. Hlaree is acutely aware that in  
+_>8) this, her first important negotiation, she’s being judged by all her fellow Red Wizards.
Continuing around the table, Red Wizard Harazulkh Orblaun has had enough of the contrary nature and curt refusals of important senior Ang Harrad merchant Alamrund Draug 
+_>9) and is now forcefully mingling not-so-veiled threats with trading details into Draug’s ear.
For his part, Draug is looking away at us, as we look in on the scene, and wondering if we can be seized upon as a distraction. He needs one, for although he’s  
+_>10) drained his wine for the sixth time, things aren’t going any better (There. That ought to give any DM enough to portray all of these NPCs in a PC's first meeting with any of them. :} )

Sun Apr 24 14:37:11 (Athkatla, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] I was wondering if you could share any information regarding the Bellows of Milil?
I know that it's an unusually powerful pipe organ held in Arbalest's House, in Athkatla. But knowing that Milil himself stayed there, I'd be surprised if it wasn't slightly magical  
+_>1)
The Bellows of Milil is actually part of Arbalest’s House. That is, its swellbox, windchest, most of its pipes, its stops, and the three rooms with lifting and falling (pumping) floors that form its air reservoir and bellows
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) are all built into the walls, floors, and ceilings of the (largely stone) temple. The entire building resonates when the organ is played, leading to deeper notes that can be felt for blocks around, and even in the harbour 
+_>3) waters. Many parts of the Bellows are large enough to walk in, and hide in, and there are temple rumours (some of them true) about priests hiding in side-chambers within the organ, some of which can be sealed off so an 
+_>4) occupant isn’t killed by the sound reverberations pulverizing their brains if the organ is played while they’re inside.
Other rumors (also true!) say that certain of the internal wind-passages and chambers of the organ are 
+_>5) routes to gates/portals (upright midair ovals) created by Milil that lead to other temples, planes where the god dwells or has power or likes to visit, and locales in the wilderlands of the Realms where he likes to sing and 
+_>6) play. Much of the temple’s treasure (in terms of perfectly-formed gemstones, not coins for everyday transactions) is hidden in false pipes amid the real ones, around the outside of the organ. The vast organ has three 
+_>7) separate consoles that it can be played from: the main front seat with full pedals and four tiers of keyboards, a small “upper console” used by a second player to manage swells and hold drone-chords during some of the most 
+_>8) sacred (critics sometimes use the word “fearsome”) anthems, and a hidden interior master console that can lock or silence (by disconnecting) the other consoles, and so silence the entire organ, as well as overriding the other 
+_>9) consoles to play the organ. It is most often used to secure the organ for repairs, so priests (the only folk normally allowed to approach or touch the Bellows) can travel through it for cleaning, maintenance, and repairs. 
+_>10)
An additional temple rumour, which has been true at some times, is that various “monsters” live within the Bellows, from wind walkers to volts. Tales of “The Wind Dragon” are entirely fanciful, but various creatures have 
+_>11) entered the Bellows through gates and bided within for a time; certain senior priests believe that Milil himself sends some of them for his own purposes. 
+_>12)
The Bellows has several spells built into it by Milil that are unleashed by playing particular chords (“wild” combinations that would never be played in most music-making). One of them creates a strong defensive magical 
+_>13) ward around the temple, another unleashes a beam of magic that can be aimed to attack targets in the air, on the sea, or on the ground near the temple, and the third is some sort of mass teleport, details unknown.

Mon May 02 16:44:42 (Realmslore)

?_> [@] Related to this, but parallel. I've noticed a lot of spells, and magic items, are rather thematic in their appearance and requirements. The 3.5e BoExaltedDeeds even has demon armor changing appearance if redeemed.
Is popular association a common magic component, officially? 
+_>1)
Yes. However, different spellcasters may use different somatic, verbal, and material components when casting the same spell, and end up with exactly the same effects.
Usually (but not always; in arcane magic, there are ALWAYS exceptions), both the verbal and the 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) somatic components consist of a "call to mind" or evoking chant or phrase (the "incantation" or "the flourish/intricacies") and a release (the final trigger word or the end gesture). For items, just the release is more common (think the MCU finger-snap for the #Realmslore 
+_>3)
Infinity Stones. Material components vary with the culture and life experience of the caster: what symbolizes something, or is associated with it (like the old 1e "classroom stuff to generate static electricity" for lightning bolt) varies from caster to caster. 
+_>4)
Which is one reason casters can readily improvise alternative material components if they don't have "the usual" on hand, though doing so might modify the spell effects. Many apprentices just "learn the material components" without necessarily realizing or ever  
+_>5) knowing the symbolism/connection; for them, the spell works because they've seen their mentor cast it in the past (or someone else, or done it successfully themselves), so their mind "knows" the spell will work with these components.

Regarding Gullykin near Durlag's Tower; Volo claims its a Halfling town, FRCS 3e says Human/Gnome. Volo has more info so I prefer that, but do you have an opinion? I also put it 1/2 way between Durlags and Uldoon Trail, is that about right or is it closer to Durlags? 
+_>1)
Hi!
Gullykin is about 80 percent halflings, but several adventuring bands retired there to make wine and “trailmeet” and other agricultural products for a living, and some of their human and gnome members became envoys for the
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) village and most of its ruling “Moot” (council of nine). Which led some outsiders to think Gullykin had become a human-and-gnome settlement. The truth: gnomes are about 6 percent of the population, and humans about 10 percent. 
+_>3)
Your locations are good! One note: Durlag’s Tower stands in a lightly forested dell; what it’s close to it’s the edge of the dense main forest that hasn’t been logged “as long as anyone can remember” and is thick and 
+_>4) nigh-trackless (impassable for wagons, riders who try to stay mounted, or any groups of folk trying to walk in any sort of formation). I say “nigh” because there ARE game-trails.

The countryside around Gullykin is gently-rolling farmland and ranchland, with plentiful springs and ponds, small woodlots everywhere, and a maze of winding dirt wagon-lanes (well signposted).

?_>Hey [@] any thoughts on the best place to grab a high-end meal in Waterdeep’s Sea Ward? I checked Volo’s and he didn’t seem to have any strong recommendations

Volo winces at the thought of paying what good meals cost in Sea Ward, and behaving long enough to not get thrown out of wherever you’re eating them.
Seriously, the answer to this depends on the depths of your purse. If it really doesn’t matter to you how much  
+_> [@] 2) you spend, and you don’t need live entertainment or space for a party of diners larger than five or six, who don’t want to be rushed through their meal but don’t expect to spend all night sitting there waiting for the next “remove” to be brought, the three  
+_> [@] 3) current best places (NOT the haughtiest, but the best food) are:
Varneira’s Finest for a primarily seafood menu;
Ormanthar’s Big Belly for simple fare (roast meat, stews, strong cheese and bread handloaves for sides, with pickles and “darzuth” [what we would  
+_> [@] 4) call antipasto] for taste garnishes); and Flyntar’s Board for “the full board” (roasts, spitted fowl, soups, rice and vegetable dishes with shrimp or clam or lobster garnishes, fish “messed with” to gain non-fishy dominant flavors, and a broad menu of pastas  
+_> [@] 5) and other “dishes from afar”).
Varneira’s Finest stands on westfront Seawatch Street, four doors south of Grimwald’s Way. Run by the bubbly, still-beautiful in her sixth decade but getting slower and plumper, long hair all ringlets Varneira Trossfeather (who  
+_> [@] 6) lives above it with her all-female staff), the Finest is a two-floor labyrinth of dining rooms all connected by curtained archways and furnished like a conservative noble’s parlor (with little statuettes on plinths in the most remote corners). Gentle harp

Yes, but very unlikely. If Mystra goes down, there’s Azuth. And Savras. There’s also the vestige of Velsharoon. Yet Mystra herself has told certain Weavemasters that “echoes of Mystral abide in the Weave,” and there are a

Sat May 28 19:23:43 (City of Splendors, Realmslore, Waterdeep, the Deep)

?_> [@] [@] 
I saw a question about the size of Waterdeep. Answers had different lengths x widths for the City of Splendors. What would you say was the size of Waterdeep as of 5e? 
So far the sizes are ~3.8x1.5 miles & ~1.63x.643 miles. Thank you in advance. 
+_>1)
Waterdeep has grown in both population (density) and surface area covered, over the time of the published Realms (mid-1300s DR to kissing 1500 DR).
In the 5e era (1490s DR), Waterdeep is just under 4.5 miles north-south
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) (using as boundaries the “ring” patrol path below/outside the outermost walls, which marks the limits of normal bowshot, not the limits of city patrols, which extend for a day’s ride in all dry directions), and just over 
+_>3) miles west (low tide mark outside the Seacaves) to east (the gravel-filled trench that we modern real-worlders might call a “French drain” on the eastern edge of the Meadows, that marks the area caravans cannot camp 
+_>4) within, as it must be left free for foot and wagon traffic along the eastern edge of Undercliff).
The city’s walled-plus-eastern-cliffedge area is smaller, but don’t be misled by dimensions of Ahghairon’s Dragon Ward, which 
+_>5) was crafted in an earlier era when the inhabited (as opposed to warehouse and caravan-camping area) of the Deep was much smaller, and was only intended to protect the major core area against aerial dragon flyover, breath 
+_>6) weapon, and “stoop-pounce” attacks. The Ward has been renewed and tinkered with many times since, but its core “dome” shape can’t be extended or distorted markedly without sacrificing the stability of the entire magic.

Sat Aug 06 18:07:19 (Realmslore, Thultanthar, the Realms)

?_> [@] Ed .is it really fair to portray a 2000-year-old wizard as being so emotionally weak and inexperienced? When I imagine Telamont I can't help but feel like he'd be extremely mature and ground down by the weight of endless years. Especially if he's a 30th+ level wizard. =( 
+_>1)
Flippant response: How old are you? And you still think life is fair?
Serious response: One of the abiding themes I’ve been exploring in the Realms, for literally fifty-five years in my Realms fiction (yes, beginning before
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
D&D existed), is the effects on sanity of longevity (grief upon grief of loved ones lost, the tragic and traumatizing experiences in a long, hard life, and outliving not just friends and acquaintances but entire realms) and 
+_>3) of magic (having it flowing through you as you wield it, being hit by hostile magic, and having your own magical experiments go awry in your face). Not to mention “power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely 
+_>4)
What damage does all of that do?
What does it turn you into, and how do you cope? (The answer to that last one tells a writer or a DM a lot about how to run or portray a character.)
I’m not the only one to explore such themes 
+_>5) by any means. Paul Kemp’s SUPERB novels show us how many of the Thultanthans are affected as their lives unfold, and the writers and designers at Wizards showed us Modenkainen’s recent mental troubles (that Elminster nursed 
+_>6) him back from).
In the case of Telamont, he is indeed mature and very capable and accomplished. He’s also ground down by all those years, to the point of being broken.
Very broken.
He copes by clinging to a front or public act 
+_>7) of being in absolute control, of foreseeing things and planning and always being capably in charge. Yet this act is increasingly a hollow shell. Telamont can’t abandon it, because he sees Thultanthar as his; he is the city 
+_>8) and the city is him, and that’s what makes him important and essential. Without it, he’s nothing, and lost.
Yet it’s always an act, and he knows it, and occasionally it shows. 
+_>9)
I wish I could be in the fairness business, I really do. But I’m in the trying to convince everyone that this fantasy is real, so it matters to us all business. Sorry.

When Mystra’s grace made the crash-landing of the Netherese flying city of Anauria survivable by the Netherese (though the city was shattered beyond ever being able

Sun Jan 23 15:54:42 (Cult of the Dragon, Realmslore, Wyrms of the North, the Realms)

?_> [@] - did you ever have any thoughts about the effects of permanently ending the Rage of Dragons in 1373? Whether dragons would be able to organise again, form nations etc? If so I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks so much for all of your amazing work, sir. 
+_>1)
Hi, and you're welcome! :}
Implementing that dracorage and ending it were in-house decisions, not mine. Older, more powerful dragons are strong-willed and usually independent; they don't work well with others (except subservients, ideally kin).
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Trust is always a problem. Some wyrms are paranoid to the max, others are so arrogant that others don't want to work with them, and there's always the fear that "this entity can wipe me out on a whim, nigh-effortlessly."
All of which can make lasting  
+_>3) cooperation, as opposed to "let's go on this raid together, humble that human city, then fare you well," difficult and therefore rare.
In the Realms, dragons tend to form demesnes (territories) they consider their own (see the wildly-overlapping map of them  
+_>4) that accompanied my original run of Wyrms of the North, in DRAGON), and attack consistent interlopers unless they're scared enough to hide from them. They do form cabals and strike non-aggression pacts and "no go" agreements, often, and the cessation of the  
+_>5)
Rage didn't change that. (The Rage was a temporary collective insanity that affected wyrms to different degrees, an idea I devised before there was anything called D&D but that others developed in ways that tied it to a star, etc.) So dragons CAN organize  
+_>6) whenever they want to, but by their natures, they don't often want to. Many of them, particularly when younger and weaker than elder dragons, instinctively avoid other dragons in favour of working with lesser creatures they can dominate.
As a DM, consider  
+_>7) what motivation/project might be compelling enough to get dragons to work together? (E.g. a threat from beholders or illithids or even the Cult of the Dragon, that harms/slays/robs dragon after dragon, and word starts to get around )

The patron provides the channels to the Weave; the warlock must either find a new patron to provide new channels, or craft their own (do-able but not easy; think walking the Pattern in Roger Zelazny's Amber books).

+_>Jason [@] ruined city of Corrant, about a Km across. A well-planned balance of aquatic stone ruins to overgrown wide tracts of water marsh. A temple was at the center of the ruin. Now back above ground for 100 years in a wet, Naga filled area. 
+_>Do you have a map, Sir?  [@]  :00 PM · Aug 28, 2022· 
+_>1)
I’m afraid not. Developing Corrant was an in-house staff project; the only draft map I saw was a very rough sketch, and I don’t have a copy. It would be covered under my NDA, anyway.
Corrant and other Cities of the Sword look rather like many North American  
+_>2) college campuses: grand buildings seemingly built at random, rather than with any sort of urban planning (grid streets, or grand straight avenues, separating areas of like-use structures). Hodgepodges, in other words. 
+_>3)
It’s important to remember that temples in Jhaamdath were like lounges/clubs, because for many in the urban part of the psiocracy (as opposed to farmers), faiths were a “hobby diversion” (like being the fan of a modern real-world football club) pursued for  
+_>4) entertainment/a personal edge (like being part of a betting pool), NOT exalted. So temples wouldn’t be at a center site of any importance, unless they took over a building erected for another purpose. 
+_>5)
Auppenser was the exception, but devout worship of him was personal mental development, pursued through private meditation, NOT in “great holy rites” in a big building. Faithful were encouraged to find their ideal “private place” to “be one with the god,” and it  
+_>6) was often a corner of a garden, or even in a closet. If you wanted guidance, you met with a psiarch. Usually in his or her topiary-filled personal back garden, where they had constructed THEIR ideal private place.

+_>Andy Dempz [@]  [@] Is there an Amnian flag? What's on it? 
+_>1)
Like most places in the Realms in the 1300s-1400sDR, Amn has “battle banners” carried by units in battle, and pennants that fly from fortress towers (by way of flags).
Battle banners sometimes take the shape of a golden 
+_>2) keystone, long side at the top, hung from a long-pike, whereas pennants are always long and thin tapering triangles affixed to their fly-staff along the base.
Both are scarlet, with a gold border, and in the center display a 
+_>3) badge (also seen on the surcoats of city gate and civic building doorguards) known as “The Pride of Amn.” Its use has persisted despite the changes in Amn’s governance after the Spellplague.
The Pride is a horizontal row of

Sat Mar 26 15:18:34 (Baldur's Gate, Realmslore, Sword Coast, the Realms)

?_>This might seem like a strange question out of the blue [@] but in a discussion with my jimmy rustling wife, the topic of of when specifically Baldurs Gate was created came up. Would you happen to have an approximate date for that? 
+_>1)
The problem is that the good natural harbour around which Baldur’s Gate developed was a pirate and smuggler’s haven, and supported a tiny settlement of fisherfolk, for many years before Balduran first set sail from it.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
It was a known port of call for ships on the Sword Coast by 204 DR (i.e. by then it had “visitors wharves” and a shipyard, and could replace masts and sails). It was known as Baldur’s Gate, and considered a city, by 446 DR 
+_>3)
So, sometime “earlier” (before 0 DR) was when it was founded, and it was likely known as Baldur’s Gate before 300 DR. The designation “city” in the Realms is based neither on the presence of cathedrals nor on precise population 
+_>4) totals/thresholds or legal incorporation, but on importance/domination of interland and rough size, and for the Gate likely came earlier rather than later due to the absence of large nearby settlements to provide competition.

Sure. Google “tail of a whale” (images) and you’ll see a lot of photos of the flukes of whales with the rest of them underwater. Pick one that’s side-on, mentally edit out the sky and the water and the “trunk” of the tail (so
Realmslore [:]

Chris [@] the word "thaele" have any special meaning to Elminster?

Elminster concocted the word “thaele” because he was unlikely to utter that syllable for any other reason than to trigger an Elminster’s Evasion spell cast on himself. To him, it was a unique nonsense word. 
+_>2)
Rathraele” was the closest ‘real’ word to it he knew, and that was the short-name of a weredragon (song dragon) who was dead by the time El first crafted his Evasion spell. Her name was pronounced “RATH-rail” and so, was 
+_>3) highly unlikely to trigger an Evasion accidentally.
Interestingly, “meerithaele” is the name of a secret “utter painkiller” drink used by halflings and gnomes to prevent shock and suffering in someone dying or sorely wounded.

Elminster now knows about this “physic” (medicine), but again, the pronounciation is “MEER-ih-thail” and so, unlikely to be an inadvertent Evasion trigger.

Tue Jun 07 23:35:01 (Abeir, Realmslore, Realmspace, Toril, the Weave)

?_> [@] 1) Greetings! I was wondering if you could expand on what being a "Weavemaster" actually means? As well, perhaps, as some examples of such folk other than El?
I've got this idea that such a person has such an intimate knowledge of the Weave that they can simply  
+_>1)
From my Twitter replies of Mar 9, 2020:
Toril and all other worlds have multiple ways of accessing the energies of each world. And usually call the non-mechanical, non-engineering ways of accessing those energies "magic."
ONE of the ways on Toril is arcane magic 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) (in D&D, wizard and sorcerer spells), and those who have the Gift (ability to wield arcane magic, which they call the Art) or study arcane magic (sages) refer to their way of accessing the energies as "the Weave." The Weave IS Mystra, the goddess of magic 
+_>3) and the Weave only extends throughout Realmspace (Toril and moons and the void/heavens around them). Other worlds have other ways of accessing energies, and may have their own equivalents of the Weave (not identical, and not governed by Mystra) or may not 
+_>4)
Abeir likely has an equivalent, because it's the sister world of Toril, so similar and even sometimes (the Sunderings) contiguous with Toril, so that elements of the two worlds get swapped, but Weave-based spells don't work on Abeir; but innate spellcasting  
+_>5) abilities do. I.e. the world energies are similar enough that magical effects can be near-duplicated, but not how they're brought about.
So in theory, a powerful archwizard from Toril would have to start all over learning how to work magic on Abeir, and if no  
+_>6) developed system of working arcane magic exists, they may never hit upon how to create magical effects on Abeir, or may spend the rest of their lives experimenting and making very little headway.
In theory, all worlds MIGHT have their own Weaves (under  
+_>7) various names) and their own gods of magic, or not. "Weavemasters" is a term I coined back in the 1990s for anyone who'd mastered the Weave (understanding its workings enough to not need the trappings of arcane magic like material, somatic, and verbal  
+_>8) components), so they could work magic by silent act of will, rather than conventional casting. Accomplished, experienced Weavemasters (like most of the Chosen of Mystra) can think of what they want to do, then mentally call on the Weave to do it. So they can  
+_>9) work magic when tied up, gagged, and so on, when traditional casters would be rendered helpless. They control the Weave only so much as they call upon it, and so are not the same as a deity of magic who is the Weave (e.g. Mystra) or who governs the Weave. 
+_>10)
So Mystra IS the Weave within Realmspace only, and is greater than a Weavemaster. Other worlds have other systems of magic, and even Toril has other systems of magic (divine magic, for example). Most other systems of magic use the Weave for convenience, but  
+_>11) need not do so (travel from real-world place to real-world place is easier using the existing road system, but could be accomplished, in many cases, by not using the existing road system).

All of the Torilian languages have different words for a spider versus a “monster” spider (poisonous or of head-of-the-speaker size or larger), AND all have different words/forms for singular and plural, so here we go:
Draconic: klajus (plural klajan), arklajus
Realmslore [:]

Drow: orb is any spider, orbb is plural of any spider, lhorb is a lone spider the speaker considers dangerous, lhorbbyth is more than one such spider, and yilorb (plural yilorbbyth)  
+_>3) is a riding-spider
Dwarvish: norskul is any lone spider, norskulla is the plural, all spiders are monsters, and a known-to-be-deadly spider would be termed a yaunorsk (peril-spider, “yau” [pronounced “yaw”] being a known peril/hazard/danger) 
+_>4)
Elvish: orbryn is any spider, obra is the plural, horb is a monster-spider, and horbra is more than one of them
Gnomish: norl is any spider, norra is the plural, harnor is a monster-spider, and harnorl is more than one monster-spider

However, Ilmatari are dedicating their suffering to Ilmater, not Loviatar; that irks Her.

Sat Jan 01 23:28:51 (Cormyr, Dragonreach, Forgotten Realms, Realmslore, Sembia, Westgate)

?_> [@] I was wondering if you have had any thoughts of noble houses in Sembia(Forgotten Realms). I know of a few from the official Novels, but was wondering if you had any other noble families up your sleeve? 
+_>1)
The problem (for a sage or cataloger) with Sembian nobility is that they’re self-styled (i.e. anyone with wealth or nerve enough can call themselves noble, and MIGHT get away with it; over the years, many have, including a fair number of charlatans who adopt the 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) surname of a currently prominent noble house and pretend to be a part of it, sometimes accusing the ‘real’ nobles of being impostors).
So there’s never been any clear, agreed-upon list, at all.
Moreover, most of the wealthy nobles have a “country estate 
+_>3) (hunting lodge or feasting-house or food farm or horse-breeding ranch, or some combination of those) in “upcountry” (northern) Sembia, and houses or rented-out business premises in most of Sembia’s cities, with a luxurious mansion in at least one, so it’s hard 
+_>4) to say where any Sembian “noble” family is based—especially when they have internal feuds, and each side claims to either be the only legitimate branch of the family, or the senior branch. And you can find bastard or black sheep sons and daughters and nephews  
+_>5) and nieces “cast off” to live alone or with “lower-born companions” just about anywhere in the Dragonreach, Cormyr, and Sembia proper (and for real criminals, Westgate, too).
So here are some of the longer-established, “oldcoin” Sembian noble families not yet  
+_>6) featured in official Realms fiction (though some of these have been mentioned at Candlekeep or in my columns on the Wizards website or other places).
I present the houses of:
Aukanor
Beltarn
Duthtan
Harcantel
Hilmhaven
Horstanneth
Ircrimmeth
Kremond
Kylantor 
+_>7)
Olandor
Orvrant
Ravensword
Rylant
Szabelzar
Selandovur
Tarantur
Waeln
Yhauntyl and the house known as either Zhaundyl or Zhondammur, depending on which family members you heed.
That ought to be enough lofty, flamboyant, ill-behaved folk to get you started. :}

?_> [@] [@] is there a "good" reason nobles, who aren't indebted, would die of disease in Faerun?
It's the *one* part of "The Godcatcher" I keep overthinking. Two nobles withering away to featherlung while healers look on bugs the gamer in me 
+_>1)
Many possibilities. Here are a few:
They mistrust healers or healing magic and won't use them.
They fear far worse from a family curse they've been told about since toddlers, if they let healing magic be cast on them.
The residues of various magics cast on them 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) in the past "twist" healing magics awry to advance the featherlung rather than quell it.
Foes are covertly either reinfecting them or casting magics on them that quell the healings that get cast.
In dreams, they've seen themselves turned into monsters by magic 
+_>3) cast on them, and so will refuse it.
In dreams, they've seen themselves or the head of the family or an ancestor they revered deemed "unclean"/unworthy in the eyes of a deity once magic was cast on them, and so refuse it.
And so on. 
+_>4)
In the Realms as in real life, people are people. They may hold odd or illogical beliefs or views, and so won't always do what's most prudent or safe or logical.
And that goes DOUBLE for nobles.

Thread, Continued:
Kata Strophie [@] Morning Mr. Greenwood! If you were to take a young maiden on a date in Silverymoon, what are the places to see? Any specific alehouse, romantic sites to sit and talk, or any activities you'd recommend to a young  
+_>31) couple in love in the Gem of the North?"
Theatrical Performances
Theatrical performances on offer in the Gem of the North are as plentiful and varied as one might expect, but in type they vary from intimate revues [short plays performed by a small cast  
+_>32) up close” (sometimes in a small room with the audience seated on three sides of the performers)], such as at Sarandrar’s Small Stage on Brightbuckler Street [the beige rectangular building immediately east of the “1” of the “21” on the map], performances  
+_>33) from highnoon onwards, audience sizes typically growing larger as the day draws on) to three-act costumed productions in large halls like Devaerre’s Dancing Dracolich on Dancer’s Mask Lane [E side of the eastern arc of the Lane, the small gray rectangular  
+_>34) building one S of the northernmost building that’s adjacent to the city wall], typically performed from dusk onwards.
There are bawdy dinner theater farces, full of rude and naughty quips and situations, such as are offered at Jampart’s Firetrumpet on  
+_>35)
Many Cats Lane [the small beige rectangular building on the S side of the Lane, three doors E of its moot with the eastern arc of Dancer’s Mask Lane, that has a stand of trees immediately behind/S of it] (naughtiest) or the Torchtower on the Moonway [corner  
+_>36) building with round tower at its NW corner, that’s on the E side of the Moonway south of the Moonbridge, at the corner where the street that runs west from “30” joins the Moonway] (more witty and topical-political), and for the more unusual, there are  
+_>37) mood strolls” in Sakul’s Palace on Many Cats Lane [N side, the zigzag-shaped large gray building equidistant between the “4” and the “33” numerals on the map], where patrons walk along a lit path through a decorated-to-look-like-places-elsewhere set adorned  
+_>38) with macabre art and populated by actors clad in monster costumes, as hidden singers, pipers, and harpists set a mood.
Concerts
Silverymoon offers a huge variety of music at all times, but for romance, go for a candlelit concert, and warm, gentle (or  
+_>39) occasionally warmer and more sensuous) music, the sort provided by bards, minstrels, and musicians of superb skills and sensitivity. In a venue such as Jalakkul’s Horn on Rallowglass Ride [the wedge-shaped beige building on the N side of the Ride, at its  
+_>40) docks end, four doors east of where the Ride crosses Dancer’s Mask Lane], you can hear music to fall in love by, or deeper in love by, performed on such unusual instruments as the waterhorn (like a bassoon, but with the musician’s wind through a reverberating  
+_>41) column of radiant water) and the deepdrone, as well as the more familiar handharp.
Or, as tastes differ, follow your ears
Street Performances
In “the Rallow” [the large open space northwest of where Rallowglass Ride meets Many Cats Lane, nigh the city  
+_>42) wall], dine on savory cheese-and-garlic hot gnawsticks or sweet wyverntails (almond, cashew, and orange-rind dark chocolate gnawsticks) and sip mint wine or warm duck broth, as you take in a debate-duel between two learned, witty, and grand-tongued sages, on  
+_>43) a ridiculous topic that’s chosen by the drawing of a card. You’ll be standing in the street, one of many forming a ring about the Dueling Tongues (or Battling Longbeards).
Or walk to the Foregate at the Sundabar Gate (the “square” inside the gate, between  
+_>44) the three defensive fortified barracks) and see an orator declaim some of the prophecies of Alaundo that have already befallen, as talented singer-actors perform interpretations of the events they describe, beside him. The meteor “Prophecy Banner” will be  
+_>45) flown over the square when performances are imminent.
So I must do my usual morning tweets and then rush off to the day job now, so we'll finish up with Clubs and Eateries and "Opportunities" tonight, and send our dating couple off in style. :} )

If you MUST assault the Castle, the best way to do it is commando style, using swift, small "hit teams" who assemble in the city over time, then attack from within when weather is bad and you've goaded idiot nobles or guilds into providing an unwitting diversion.

Halthandrus Saerrentaun, an aging, rotund man-mountain gourmand, glutton, and jovial friend-to-many (who behind his affable manner is a coldly ruthless friend of none) is the patriarch of the Saerrentaun family, whom he

A fourth family, the Immurtalans

+_>6)
Like the other “great towers” of the city, the Spires of Saerrentaun has reception rooms, warehousing space, and stables at ground level, granaries and pantries above, kitchens and some soaring rooms-of-state above that, five

This is something left to DMs for shaping their own campaigns. With Roger Zelazny's blessing, I borrowed his idea that substances worked differently in different worlds (the title of "The Guns of Avalon," his second Amber novel, refers to jeweler's rouge, not 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) gunpowder, explodes in Amber) for the Realms. So I planted the principle but left the details fuzzy so a DM can vary what things do from place to place because it affects gate/portal mercantile traffic (and wars, and so geopolitics).
I can tell you, from  
+_>3) established Realmslore, that mithril and adamantine (the refined alloys) behave more or less the same on Earth as in the Realms, and that an Earth chemist would be able to tell they were alloys, but involving unknown-to-them main ingredients. Most mages of

Faerûn devote so much time to spellcraft that they tend to approach metals they encounter in either the rock-bottom-practical sense (this takes a cutting edge and is hard = good knife) or the experimental one (what happens if I try to use this as a spell  
+_>5) component?). So I left things deliberately fuzzy, and TSR left such lore alone because they wanted to avoid the whole subject of links between the real world and their game worlds, during what we now call "the Satanic Panic."
However, we had many fun debates  
+_>6) and speculations at GenCons and my annual around-a-GenCon TSR visits, and they spawned features of other settings and adventures. I still think this should be left to DMs as a Big Underpinning of a campaign, like überplots.

Well met! Metagame: I THINK Horizikaul is the creation of Sean K. Reynolds, but I may be wrong about that, and the name (plus the fact that he was obviously a creator of sonic-related spells) is about all we know of him in published Realmslore.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
To that, I can extrapolate this much: his name suggests that he’s from Halruaa but of Tashlutan or Calishite heritage. Sonic spells are a chancy—and so, mistrusted in Halruaa—field of magic, which suggests Horizikaul is an independent, perhaps even defiant  
+_>3) sort, and is likely not a respected “establishment” Halruaan. That plus the nature of the spells leads me to think he’s an adventurer, wandering the Realms, but either not successful or very much not an attention-seeker (as he hasn’t established himself as a  
+_>4) local fixture anywhere).
So he’s another of our many loose ends that you can do what you like with. :}
If it were me, I’d have him living quietly in his own tower either in a rural area or in a small town, semi-retired from a successful adventuring career  
+_>5) and devoting himself to his researches. Which could either be a dastardly, dangerous-to-the-world plot, or helpful and business-related (someone has to turn out all those useful enchanted weapons, tools, and doodads, you know). 
+_>6)
Either way, he’d likely have some powerful automatons as guardians, to deter thieves and would-be Horizikaul-slayers. (And Mordenkainen is a very different sort of character: he’s one of the most important and powerful wizards of Greyhawk, the founder of the  
+_>7)
Circle of Eight, and was recently nursed back to sanity by Elminster.) 
+_>
?_>I’ve been told you know a lot about DnD and the Forgotten Realms. 3 hours ago I started a quest searching for some information about Horizkaul which has 3 spells with his name on them. After some more searching, I found a book called Magic of Faerûn but that (1/2) Didn't have anything either, do you know anything about this Horizkaul guy? I'm really curious to know.
They also told me he might have a similar story to that of Mordenkainen (Idk who that is) and that's it. . Thank you! (2/2)

Certainly. They're trying to get a shorter, faster, cheaper bulk goods shipping route linking them on the north shore of the Moonsea with the Sword Coast, and reliable rail would cut down on "keeping pack animals alive in the desert." Actual rails buckle and 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) twist in high heat if they're metal, and blowing sand threatens any railed system (derailments/burying the rails) so Zhent magelings will be kept busy with spells dealing with such problems. Meaning they'll be making constant patrols (= being targets).

This notion was discussed in-house at TSR, back in the day: various things the Zhents might try for goods transport (I'd already stressed the unreliability of gates/portals for bulk transport, to explain why it hadn't been done from ancient times onward).

From the earliest times of local settlement, elves beautified the few local natural caves (mainly narrow crevices in Standing Stone Hill)

?_> [@] Personally, I'd love to hear more about this Ed. Monks are this odd bit of orientalism that gets thrown into largely western settings. So ways to make them feel at home are very interesting.

I see most monks (the game class, that is) as the weapons-masters of temples who teach unarmed or improvised weapon training (as opposed to the expert archers, slingers, and swordswingers)--or their star pupils. Sent out into the world either by the temple, on

?_> [@] [@] Is Unther that powerful nowadays, tho? 
+_>1)
It's not the power of any one foe, it's the "war on far too many fronts" peril. Szass Tam is a many-times-over failure, so he's insecure, and he KNOWS (from past experience with Aglarond and with Rashemen) that even a weaker foe can occupy and "pin" his forces
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) as others charge in to raid or full-scale invade the rest of unprotected Thay. Yes, he can let that happen and rule the undead left behind when Thay has fallen and been depopulated but he knows how hollow that will feel. AND fears dracoliches will be busily  
+_>3) installed by a certain Cult.
And, deep down, he fears what alliances the Princes (the dragon rulers) may have made, and that he can't even handle THEM. After all, if he displeases Mystra further and she sends Chosen to battle him over the Athora at just the  
+_>4) wrong-for-him time 
This is the situation of most rulers in the Realms. The interconnectedness of all things weighs heavily on their minds when they contemplate sending armies on the march. What if I ? Wouldn't a few adventurers sent to assassinate, that  
+_>5)
I can plausibly deny, be better? ;}
And as much as Tam may dismiss and despise them, there ARE Thayans in exile, Red Wizards or mages powerful enough to wear the Red, who hate him (see the recent Thay book I did with [@] and [@] ) and are lurking

?_> [@] [@] [@] [@] Interesting. Do you have list of these stories and novellas and such? 
+_>1)
Here’s a partial list [* = a Mirt story, % = published by TSR/WotC]
In 1965, I wrote two short story fragments that were combined the next year to become:
One Comes, Unheralded, To Zirta (1966)
The Box of Dreams (1966)
Vultus Triumphant (1966)
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Too Old A Wolf (1967)
The Bringer of Doom (1967)
Hazanth’s Trifling Error (1967)
The Sword That Sang (1967)
How Silent the Spectre (1968)
How Vrackmulkyn Learned The Truth (1968)
Mirt and the Dragon Inexorable (1969) 
+_>3)
Too Many Ghostly Knights (1969)
The Last Mistake of Voroon Ouz (1969)
Nine Swords Unaccounted For (1969)
I took a break from the Realms at this point to write a non-Realms novel, Fool’s Master, and twenty or so unrelated short stories, many of them  
+_>4) parodies or pastiches.
So this is the earliest stuff. Mostly published in long-gone magazines and chapbooks.

Mon Mar 28 15:44:51 (Time of Troubles, home Realms campaign)

?_> [@] Question: Are you using the current Realms campaign as it is published or a divergent lore for you game?
Fate of the Norns seems interesting, I've never played it before. 
+_> [@] The home Realms campaign has been running continuously since 1978, and hasn't yet reached the 1380sDR. When we do, it will likely diverge, as the players and DM vote on metagame things (like game edition, character classes) and they've already voted down the Time of Troubles. 
+_> [@] Fate Of The Norns is a fascinating Viking-era roleplaying game created, designed, and published by Andrew Valkaukas. It uses runes instead of dice, and can be played at 3 different levels of crunch at the same gaming table, so a novice to the game can play alongside a veteran. 
+_> [@] (At the simplest level, anything you say your character is doing that's new [i.e. NOT "continue walking down the path"] and that's a verb, costs you a rune to accomplish and runes are played for special abilities and to parry and also reflect damage to characters. 
+_> [@] The current edition of Fate Of The Norns is set during Ragnarok, with no sun in the sky and the world growing colder. Andrew and I are crafting a complete, detailed city, Ath Cliath (a fantasy version of Viking-ruled Dublin, which happened in real life), circa 835 AD. 
+_> [@] EVERY building detailed, every character who lives there has a dirty secret DETAILED. (And usable with any roleplaying game.) The city boxed set was Kickstarted as part of the Ultimate Viking Anthology, which gets you a STACK of novels and graphic novels. One novel visits  
+_> [@] Ath Cliath, and another (my novel) is entirely set there (so read it, and you'll know what the city looks and smells like, how people dress and talk, etc.).
We're having a LOT of fun! (And I have another few city blocks to write up today.)

?_>Hey [@] , I was looking back at your book "City System" - very great I must add - but there was one section that had me scratching my head.
In clothing I identified those unfamiliar as being real Middle Ages wear, like escoffion & hennin, but what is a "cap-of-coins" ? 
+_>1)
A cap of coins is just that: a skullcap, usually covering the entire head from the tops of the ears all around, often resting on the ears and sometimes held firm on the head with its own hidden clips (like the sort of metal
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) clips used in earlier decades to hold curlers on), that is made entirely of coins attached to each other with fine wire or chain, to form an open-weave/open-mesh cap (i.e. there are spaces between the coins so the wearer’s 
+_>3) hair can be seen). Usually round or oval small coins are used, usually matched as opposed to a mix, and usually copper pieces. Yes, they sometimes get used as currency, and most wearers of such caps will know how many 
+_>4) coins their cap is made of (often 40). Such caps are an ideal garment for being enspelled; many keep rain or snow off a wearer, or confer the same powers as a ring of warmth.

See pages 16-18 of THAY: LAND OF THE RED WIZARDS.

So if you're known to be an arcane spellcaster, it's be accepted, or get out of Thay, or die.

Seems like an attractive career path!" (Realmslore, Red Wizards, Spellplague)

Well, on page 12 you’ll find a passing culinary note about the popularity of ‘adorned’ honey in Nethjet. Then on 
+_>3) page 39 and especially page 40, our tour of all the tharches of Thay describes Nethjet and its rival city Nethentir (which itself gets rather more attention on Page 39).

+_>4) half-elven Thayan merchant Shelmazra Hornwyntur (who? Well, that’s her on the cover, in blue, pointing at the map) takes the reader to Nethjet and shares her favorite places to trade, stay, shop, eat, see, and stay away from. 
+_>5)
Major streets are named, she tells us what meets the eye and ear and nose, and even where to pray if you want to be seen doing so.
In short, all a DM needs, unless Nethjet is going to become a longterm haunt of the PCs. 
+_>[:] 
+_>And if Nethjet DOES become a longterm haunt of the PCs, don't worry: there's all the REST of the book to draw on.
That introductory adventure Alex designed COULD happen in Nethjet.
Dar'lon Ma's next little scheme to shake the rulership of Thay COULD unfold in Nethjet.

?_>Dear Mr. [@] , as of 1357 DR, is Telpir an independent city-state or part of Turmish? If the former, what kind of government does it have? What title does its monarch / ruler receive? Thanks in advance. 
+_>1)
Telpir is (and was, in 1357) a “friendly ally” of Turmish, with a firm trading pact that included “port haven” rights (damaged ship of either can enter the “approach waters” of the other’s harbor, fly the distress flag, and are entitled to a speedy tow and 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) repair, not having to negotiate for such services). At times, the citizenry of Telpir was dominated by folk from Turmish. However, it was never “part” of Turmish. Its border with Turmish was within sight of Telpir’s city walls (which formed a semicircle  
+_>3) around the landward edges of the city, not extending along its shore), a low drystone wall marked by rickety wooden lookout towers that had a history of falling down during fierce storms.
Telpir had a voting advisory council of nine elected by in-city  
+_>4) landowners (every four summers), the Archave, who made overall policy decisions and conveyed them to a ruling Lord of Telpir, who was responsible for policing and sanitation and law courts, and other “daily operational” matters. Some Lords “creatively  
+_>5) interpreted” the policy directives sent by the Council, and others acted more as a spokesperson/figurehead. Most of the time, the head of the Tower of the Morning (Telpiran temple of Lathander) had as much influence with the Lord as the Archave did.

Seems like a huge opportunity for a future realm-shattering event!
From Volo's Guide to Monsters: [:]

That passage reads like a wild tavern tale (or illithid propaganda) to me.
If the illithids had truly mastered time travel, they’d have conquered everyone long ago, and we’d all be tended herds of future meals for them, allowed to have interesting lives to give 
Realmslore [:]

The gith really did defeat the mind flayers, because the illithids had become so lazy and decadent and reliant on their slaves that they left everything to  
+_>3) these thralls and grew careless and overconfident. The “absence of ruins” suggests that whoever made this statement was unaware that the illithids had vast empires that included outposts on many worlds (the Realms among them), traveling from one to another  
+_>4) mainly via gates/portals but also by spelljamming and other means of planar travel, and that any ruins—and surviving empires, for that matter—are just elsewhere, not in the Realms or other outposts, and that any structures the illithids had thralls build for  
+_>5) them in the Realms have long ago been taken over (or dismantled for their stone) by others. In the Realms, large communities of mind flayers are almost exclusively in the Underdark—and there’s a LOT of competition for useful caverns and passages down there  
+_>6) (aboleths, drow, duergar, dwarves, svirfneblin, myconids and on and on).
Me, I try to avoid realm-shattering events. They're hard on we who live there. ;}

?_>Thanks for the reply! It's a very evocative name so it makes sense two writers might use it independently. Didn't mean to imply any intentional pilfering, but the original poster on reddit wondered if it might have been borrowed accidentally/subconsciously

?_> [@] Mr. Greenwood, but a question remains, what would the realmers call such a music? Thank you!

To folk of the Realms, just "music." They don't tend to speak/think of musical genres/movements as we do, just in terms of social norms: thudding drums, wailing warhorns, and unison shouts = goblinkin; drums and metallic percussion = dwarves; flutes and harps and
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) soft-voiced harmonies = elves, ditties and/or plainsong = humans or halflings, dronesong (with warhorns) = giants. Within local society (e.g. a city), musical shifts tend to be discussed linked to individuals or groups, the same way real-world sports speak of  
+_>3) the X era," where X is the name of a dominant athlete (like Jordan in basketball, or Favre or Brady in football). In the Realms, dance fads and fashions do get named, and their associated music with them, like lammuer (slow waltzes), tonsets (slow formal  
+_>4) courtly dances), and whirls (reels). Folk in the Realms also distinguish between "elder-time" or "ancient" tunes and songs, "traditional" tunes or styles of music, and "newclang" (innovative and fresh, seen as either good or bad depending on personal taste).

+_>1)
A beholder can alter themselves without limit by their dreaming, because any internal changes are done instinctively (i.e. they don't have to understand every facet of how things work).
The moment they're dreaming of another entity than themselves, they DO have 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) to understand every last detail of the functioning bodily systems of that entity, to 'dream them up.' So even though beholders are geniuses, they almost always are A) transforming an already-living creature of the same sort (mammal, reptile, etc.) as what  
+_>3) envisage, and B) are really "reskinning" a beholder in terms of organs and inner workings, because that's what they understand (unless they've done a LOT of breeding, dissections, and other examinations, of other sorts of creatures).
And in the same way  
+_>4) that most kids trying to "make up" new monsters usually think of a stuck-together assembly of features (jaws, talons, tentacles, wings, etc.) of various creatures they're already familiar with, that's how a beholder trying to dream up a new species is usually  
+_>5) going to arrive at something: a hodgepodge of known bits and pieces. If a beholder makes developing new species (long-term breeding for selected traits program, surgical and magical experimentations, etc.) its chief focus of interest, they may achieve stable  
+_>6) new species beyond these 'limits of time and attention' with a surprising degree of success.

Many healing potions in the Realms display a circle device on the vial or the wax seal over the stopper. That unadorned, simple circle means healing, and is the closest thing to a "beneficial medical aid" rune or badge.

Some healers and "physics" (sellers of medicines, ointments, bandages, and splints) display a banner or signboard with that circle surrounded by radiating rays (simple lines running outwards) to denote medicine. (Clergy don't, as it's assumed.)

?_> [@] Greetings, good sir. I want to use the elven/gnome created portal system known as the Trail of Mists. Can you provide some words gnomes would use in reference to it? 
+_>1)
Sure!
To gnomes, a known route is a “thaunr.” [pronounced “THAWN-urr”]
A gate (portal) is a “duklim.” (lim [pronounced “leem”] = magic + “dukl” = step/stride [“duk” is boot, and is pronounced “duck-h”]
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
A linked series of portals (a portal system) is a “duklimaunr.” [pronounced “duck-LEEM-on-urr”]
To use (step through/traverse) portals is “duklimduk” [pronounced “duck-LEEM-duck”] 
+_>3)
So if a gnome wanted to say “She walked the portals,” they’d say “Maran duklimduk” [“maran” = she, “daran” = he]
A (surface) trail is a “lurthaun.” [A surface road is an “athurr.”]
Mists are “bluth” [fog or opaque, persistent 
+_>4) mist is “obluth,” overcast is “oblann,” a cloud is an “oblass” and clouds are “oblassan”]
So if a gnome translating “Trail of Mists” literally into Gnomish would say “Lurthaun ar Bluth.” [ar = of]

?_>What level would a wizard have to be to create a mythal? Would they have to be of the same level to adjust or change it? [@] #forgottenrealms #dnd5e 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Looking over past editions there are a few commonalities:
They require multiple wizards to create.
They take a very long time to make.
They require high level magic.
If the tiniest thing goes wrong, it is catastrophic.
A few options you could think of emulating or using: 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Look at spells like Guards & Wards, Temple or Gods, etc. They utilize repeated casting over a given period to create a permanent effect. You could use a similar function.
Look at them as simply a magic item that has a really long crafting time with rigorous requirements. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Considering components:
Mythals often have a core - in the case of High Elven Mythals it is often the body and soul of the lead caster. So, keep that in mind. th edition doesn’t have epic spells currently, and Mythals in 3.5 required the Mythal spell seed. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] I’d suggest, if you have players wanting to create one, decide if they are making a Wizard Mythal or a High Elven one. If it is a High Elven one, I’d suggest having the caster track down a Selu’kiira (High Elven Lore Gem) that might contain the necessary knowledge. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] As for manipulating a Mythal, most were keyed specifically to certain magical objects and only the wielder could manipulate them. But, anyone with knowledge and the object could manipulate it. To safely do it, I’d suggest a 3rd or 4th tier wizard. I hope this all helps! 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Thanks [@] , that surely helps. 
+_> [@] [@] [@] [@] has covered the topic masterfully. The core thing is that most mythals required the sacrifice of the key caster: their body and soul were subsumed, and they exist as a sentience in the muthal (akin to "a voice in the Weave"). 
+_> [@] [@] [@] If your multiple casters were learned enough in mythal lore AND CASTING EXPERIENCE, and powerful enough, they could all give a part of themselves to fashion a "dumb" mythal (so all lose levels, hp, etc.), but this has always been rare.

?_>Yet another mystery of the realms What is Gaj in the vilhon reach? [@] I have no idea and only Gaj I know is a cockroach from Dark Sun #ForgottenRealms #DnD [:] 
+_>1)
Gaj is a major market town in the foothills of the western end of The Maerthwatch mountains, where copper and silver (and a little gold) from local mines are smelted. Dwarves work the (shallow) mines, gnomes turn the copper
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) into wire in Gaj’s foundries, and traders come from coastal Chondath and Chessenta to buy the items made in Gaj (both wire grips for tolls and weapons, and wire mounts for jewelry and handles, such as wooden handles for 
+_>3) teapots and other hot vessels).
Gaj is an unwalled town that may soon become a city. It’s home to many crafters, and the surrounding farms supply it with ample goat cheese and milk, mutton, and vegetables. What its inhabitants 
+_>4) seem to want most from the wider world is clothing and woven textiles, and fine wines (local wines and ales are sour varieties).
Gaj is ruled by the Luth, an elected council of twelve senior crafters who give direction to the 
+_>5)
Gajmar (police chief), who heads the town watch (which consists of patrols of “trusties” armed with cudgels but backed up with both spies—who concentrate on outlanders—and spellcasters with bodyguards, who act against mages 
+_>6) adventurers, and others the trusties can’t handle). The Watch is mainly concerned with keeping the peace and preventing thefts, threat-blackmail, arson, and the formation of gangs. Gaj tends to be a peaceful place, as most 
+_>7) inhabitants work too hard to have time or energy for much mischief.
In 1354 DR, the period covered by my lore-notes, the Gajmar was a retired human adventurer, Lhlarauna Dashard Umurr (LG hf F9/Sor3).

?_>1/2
Hi [@] ! I hope you are well
I have some questions about the Lady of Graces in 1479 DR, Jalessa Windstone
Is it correct to say Jalessa lived in the Royal Palace of the Purple Dragon? If yes, did her chambers have a particular name? 
+_>1)
Jalessa Windstone is the third Lady of Graces; she took office in 1472 DR, succeeding the ill, retiring Lady Brunzarra Hethcanter, who held the office from 1459 DR to 1472, and succeeded the first Lady of Graces, Gevandra Mallowthar. (pronounced “Jev-RAN-dah”)
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Longtime Palace families include the Bracetels, the Duskroses, the Lionwinters, the Ormantrels, the Saraclarrs, and the Windstones.
The Lady of Graces lives in a suite in the Court, not the Palace Royal (i.e. the big building to the south ofthe Palace proper). 
+_>3)
If you look at my Suzail map in the FR ADVENTURES sourcebook, the Palace Royal (also known as the Palace of the Purple Dragon, or Castle Obarskyr) is #1 of the blue-tinted, keyed buildings, and the much larger Court (also known as the Royal Court, or the  
+_>4)
Courts of Cormyr), that fronts on the Promenade, is #4 of the blue-tinted, keyed buildings.
The offices of the Lady of Graces occupy the southernmost “bump-out” tower at the western end of the Royal Court, with the “receiving room” of her private chambers  
+_>5) immediately behind/north of them; in it is a circular staircase rising up into her lounge, robing rooms, study, bedchamber, and guest bedchamber above (both bedchambers have adjoining private garderobes).
The offices are known as the Font of Grace, and the  
+_>6) chambers of residence” of the Lady of Graces are known as the Rose Rooms, after the nickname of the first Lady of Graces (Gevandra was known as “the Evening Rose” for her great beauty: dark blue eyes and hair [not dyed, but said to be derived from half-elven blood]). 
+_>
?_>Hi [@] I hope you are well
I have some questions about the Lady of Graces in 1479 DR, Jalessa Windstone
Is it correct to say Jalessa lived in the Royal Palace of the Purple Dragon? If yes, did her chambers have a particular name? 
Were the Windstones a "palace family" like the Duskroses and the Lionwinters?
Lastly, do you know who Jalessa's predecessor was?
Thank you Ed, as always, for giving us all so much to think about and imagine.
Have a good one.

?_>are the waterways rivers or chanels in Arrabar [@] the Crying Claw tavern is said to be on the waterfront but the novels and novel map put it 2 districts away from the Reach. I'm trying to make it make sense. THanks in advance, Ed! 
+_>1)
The Port District of Arrabar is honeycombed with canals, leading to a large “turning basin” just south of the Warehouse District. So many buildings can be said to be “waterfront” that someone looking at the admittedly stylized
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) published maps of Arrabar will think are several streets inland. You can visit the Crying Claw by boat, tie up there, and depart the same way. Garbage/trash is taken away by “narrowboat” barges, out to sea and down the coast 
+_>3) for dumping, in a noisome monster-infested bay called “the Shallows
These buildings look like they’re several streets inland because they ARE several streets inland: aside from a “light well” opening down into that turning 
+_>4) basin (and which is smaller than the basin), almost all of the canals have been roofed over, giving the buildings in the area deep cellars, and streets run atop these roofs (and rainwater flows down through gratings to empty 
+_>5) into these canals).
So like real-world modern Chicago’s Loop area, with its multiple levels (there are streets under the surface streets), Arrabar’s webwork of canals underlies its streets and keeps goods shipping traffic 
+_>6) moving (you could run an entire campaign down there; the city polices the area heavily to keep boats from blocking canals to cost competitors money by preventing their timely movement; for the same reason, fishing from 
+_>7) boats, as opposed to with a fishing rod, from a balcony or window, is banned in the canals and turning basin. .despite the rumored lurking aquatic monsters).
Collectively, the canals, docks, and basin are known locally as 
+_>8) the Netherwaters,” but in daily speech this has been shortened to “Nethers” or just “Below.” It’s where “bad people” (low, criminal, and even misshapen) live and work, so many Arrabarrans never mention it at all.

Sure. As a trader using Common:
If I don’t know the gender of an individual, I’d speak of them a “one”

+_>3)
If I know an individual has been gelded/wounded and no longer has functioning genitalia: “thornless” or “shorn-thorn”
If I’m speaking of an non-gendered item (garment, tool, privy), it’s a “all-moon” item (And none of these terms are considered pejorative.)

?_>I was wondering [@] if there is an equivalent book to Debrett or Burke's Peerage in Waterdeep? 
Given the noble houses of Waterdeep, I figured someone in Waterdeep would publish a book like this realmslore [:] 
+_>1)
Waterdeep has never had full-on tomes like Debrett’s or Burke’s. (My oldest edition of Burke’s runs to six HEAVY thick hardcovers with tissue-thin paper.)
What it has is Starhaven’s Titled Vaeris, available either in per-family
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) chapbooks or thicker letter-of-the-alphabet “double bound” chapbooks.
Both follow the same format: drawn family trees on the left-hand page of a spread, and short “you should know this” entries for the most important living 
+_>3) members on the right-hand page. Anything that won’t fit is omitted, which is why discerning readers keep older editions (which have individuals in their pages that got “pushed out of” later editions by new progeny). 
+_>4)
These short entries ALWAYS include all of the formal titles of every noble.
Alandolphor Starhaven disappeared in 1286 DR; he’s widely though to have been murdered by a furious noble whose titles he got wrong. 
+_>5)
He had six daughters; their descendants pen annual new editions that every guild as well as every noble house keeps current copies of. Many clubs and snob merchants do, too, so they can properly address noble patrons.

Early Truesilvers were fond of a silver shield (heater shape, 2-engrailed top) charge that had a mauve field, and the same silver dragon large enough to almost touch the silver border on it.

How does the game designer themselves not understand what they wrote in the PHB. Paladin's don't have to follow any deity. Nowhere in the book does it say that and FOR GOOD REASON. Why would you suddenly backpaddle on this?! It makes no sense! 
+_> [@] "Backpeddle"? You seem to be under the misapprehension that I wrote the PHB.
I was answering for the Realms, not the D&D game. In the Realms, paladins first BECOME paladins by swearing an oath to one deity (exception: the Triad). They CAN change deities thereafter.

Im very familiar with ward tokens (1) 
+_>1)
Yes, "wardstones" is the colloquial term for the most common sort of ward token: an engraved stone. (Ward tokens can take other forms.) Many temples, monasteries, and abbeys have multiple simple wardstones, so only certain clergy can enter an 'inner sanctum' 
Realmslore [:]

+_>1)
Almost all subterranean dwarven (and gnome) forges use "open" lava flows or the heat of nearby magma flows for their heat; dwarves are both efficient and see this as working with nature/the will of the gods. So, nothing "unique."
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Dwarves prize "forgestones," rare enchanted items: very hard, durable (not brittle) stones, such as rock crystal, bearing permanent magics so they heat up and cool down on command, without themselves being harmed (so they can "power" a forge without need for fuel).

In Chessenta, on Deadwinter Day, skulls are eaten: small white-sugar-icing-coated sweet dough balls made with heavy cream, flour, eggs, and a lot of sugar, and pinched at one spot after “rolling round,” to

I have been asked why I have not posted one of the greatest witches in D&D lore before and the answer I have always given is I wanted to do it right [:] [:] 
?_>That is partially true. The other part is that a character like Alassra Shentrantra Silverhand has to be done with care and reverence. The love [@] has for this character shines so brightly through every word he commits to paper about her that he made me love her too.

?_> [@] So we have to think of the "City State" of Waterdeep not as a literal State that ends and the city wall, but more in the sense of a Greek City State, that usually own many of the surrounding area and smaller villages. 
+_> [@] Oh, yes. From the outset, Waterdeep needed "open land" for caravans to assemble and disassemble, linking with the deepwater port. Then warehouses, and all of that, very much including granaries and paddocks. The vicinity is well-watered, but the food always has to  
+_> [@] come from somewhere. The guards for the early encampments and stockpiled goods patrolled well beyond bowshot to curb surprise bandit raids and monster attacks. From the moment the Deep was a governed area, it defended a "home ring" of surrounding farms.

?_> [@] Well met Mr. Greenwood! Do you have any ideas for the appearance of the brand or tattoo that's placed upon a duergar when they become a "calassabrak?" 
+_>1)
Yes. :}
There are two facial tattoos (the intent is to prevent the duergar from covering them up and “passing for untainted”), usually placed high on the cheeks (under both eyes).
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
On the left cheek is the rune Alag, which means “Danger Right Here” (or “Trap”). It’s a vertical zig-zag lightning bolt joining a sphere at the top and an “X” at the bottom. 
+_>3)
On the right cheek is the rune Calas, which means “To Be Shunned/Stay Back/Don’t Touch.” It’s an X with the lines on a 45-degree diagonal, and 4 dots equally spaced in the widest part of each arc (“pie wedge”) between 
+_>4) the lines, as far out as the ends of the lines (so if you drew an invisible circle just touching all four ends of the X, it would also just touch the outer curve of each dot). 
+_>5)
Some folk who are branding an outcast also put a clan or house mark on the belly or back, with a large diagonal stroke/baton through it (across it).

Sure. I've listed Academies (as such institutions are usually known in the Realms, aside from the bardic colleges) several times in the past, but MOST teaching is done by sages (pay for and attend a class) or by tutors/governesses (nobility and wealthy hire these).

Most temples and larger city guilds also arrange instruction for interested lay faithful or guild members and apprentices. Most large temples of Oghma and Deneir have some functions akin to our modern real-world colleges.
And then there are apprenticeships

Like so many Realms answers: it depends.
On the time and place of your "regular people" and the particular Chosen AND deity.
During the Second Sundering, there was a brief period of "everybody had Chosen" (many of them lacking much "special power").
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
However, MOST Chosen are viewed as champions or heralds of a deity, so are generally perceived as superpowered equivalents of the champions and heralds of powerful rulers.
Then it comes down to personal contact, and how the Chosen behaves.

Most dwarven cities have signal-horns (think the horn Gimli blows at Helm's Deep in THE TWO TOWERS movie) built into their stonework, for rousing city defenders to "action stations" or to cry "rally" (to a previously-agreed-upon assembly area).
A few have 
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) foot-treadle-bladder devices to pump air through such "wind chambers," and in rare cases (Deep Shanatar is one) there were hand-operated stops for affecting tone, so tunes could be played (more like a riff or motif [think trumpet fanfare] in most cases than a  
+_>3) tune), but I tend to think of them more like "non-portable bagpipes that use stone-locked chambers rather than chanters and reeds" than I do an organ, though they often do have a seat, foot-pedals, and hand-operated stops. Harpsichord-like dwarf instruments  
+_>4) (strings plucked) are very rare; usually dwarves play piano-like personal instruments (strings hit with hammers; hitting things with hammers is the dwarven way). Most such dwarf instruments look more like an accordion (small portable keyboard) and have metal

?_>Greetings again, Mr. [@] 
I hope you are well.
If the deities of the Forgotten Realms only have powers and influence inside Realmspace, how could Mystra's death and the Spellplague affect the entire Multiverse? [:] 
+_> [@] See all the connecting lines on the multiverse diagram? Everything's linked and affects everything else, like ripples (or a tsunami) in a pond.
The same way a power station or even a lone transformer blowing out can take down not just "its local section" but a big adjacent area.

A lot of Undermountain magic tied to him would briefly go wild, and Chosen and other servitors of Mystra (weaveghosts, etc.) would be "sent in" to stabilize matters. Gates/portals would open in Undermountain and certain monsters would flood in (e.g. some dragons

Heh. I'd say they did, as you can't get "adamantine" without adamant (the smelted, purified, VERY hard but brittle metal = smelted, purified adamantite) as an ingredient. You CAN add steel and still get adamantine, but you can't leave out adamant.
Realmslore [:]

An alloy of "just" steel and mithral yields a steel that's better than stainless steel in terms of its rust resistance. Survives a lot of rust monster attacks, for instance. (However, dwarves and gnomes consider making it a waste of mithral.)

?_>So what is Old Cormyrean language exactly? Variant of thoras? What about modern cormyrean? [@] I couldn’t find anything in published lore 🙈 #ForgottenRealms #dnd [:] 
?_>And [@] while we are on the topic of languages. What did Volo's "pair-rot" said in what I assume is dwarwish? Poor Volo clutched all the pearls! [:] 
+_>1)
Heh. Here we go 
Dumtharak Bar-mathar!” (It’s pronounced “DOOM-tharr-ack Bar-MAY-tharr.”)
This is archaic Dwarvish (old sentence construction, little used these days).
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
The transliteration is “sick-head-yours fart-diarrhea” and the sentence construction assumes that there’s an unspoken “so” between the two phrases. 
+_>3)
So the real meaning is “You’re so crazy that your farts are all wet dung!” which is a clumsy, almost quaint (yet bluntly rude) dwarf-childrens’ insult.

Sun Jan 30 17:45:20 (Realmslore, Tethyr)

?_> [@] Hi Ed. Weird queries out of the blue as always: what can you tell us about Lycon "Wolf-Beard", one time tutor of Elminster. Does he have a surname? 
+_>1)
I can’t get to my notes at the moment (they’re somewhere in the long Hi-Cube shipping container, and it has a six-foot snowdrift-turned-to-ice in front of its doors right now), but Lycon was a jovial, hardy adventuring wizard (a gentle smartass). He was a seasoned,
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2) successful adventurer, who made a fortune out of salvaging old magic from the corpses of fallen mages or their tombs and “improving” it by combining enchantments for more effective effects, and selling scrolls of the results thereof. 
+_>3)
He roamed the Heartlands in his day, and rather than having a tower, he had six different houses, one a farmhouse but the others in cities, all nondescript and purportedly owned by average guys (all “false identities” he’d established). 
+_>4)
Full name: Lycon Annamandur Haldred. His parents were far-traveled caravan merchants, and their ancestors came from the Amn and Tethyr areas, though his father’s side of the family always claimed (likely correctly) to have come from Halruaa shortly after its  
+_>5) founding.
His nickname, by the way, came from a neat little enchantment he’d cast on his tidy, pointed beard: Lycon could teleport a wolf from a den he maintained “out of it,” so the wolf emerged springing at a foe from empty midair in front of his beard.

Henna bodypainting (sometimes quite elaborate, but wears off with skin layers) is quite common, especially south and east from the Vilhon, but permanent tattoos less so. Guilds and cults sometimes use brands (as, of course, do slavers).
Yes, different methods and

Any thoughts on which culture in Faerûn achieved this first (or at all)? realmslore #technology #dungeonsanddragons  (1/2)

The Imaskari had it, the elves had it earlier or got it from them, and the giants had it then, too.
It was lost to humans after Imaskar fell, the giants only used it for insulation (crafting shaped coverings), and the elves preferred carved wood and growing vessels.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Sometime later the dwarves gained it on their own, the gnomes and later the halflings got it from them, and it was rediscovered in the Tashalar just before 116 DR.
Always rare, expensive, and (due to fragility) little used. Much easier to make from wood or bamboo.

Wed Jun 29 00:48:24 (Dwarves' Deep, Moonsea, Realmslore, Sword Coast, the Realms)

?_> [@] I suppose it's a pretty easy question since the Realms have so many Dwarven ruins but where would you put Dwarrowdeep, [@] ? 
+_>1)
There are many good candidate sites, but what's needed is a big mountain range (big enough to host SPOILER lairs) with habitable countries on either side of it (at least one of which has a nearby-to-a-Dwarrowdeep-entrance village or hamlet), and SPOILER as dwarves.
Realmslore [:] 
+_>2)
Because of all the extensive dwarven lorework Realms sages Eric L. Boyd and George Krashos have done, plus the efforts of Jeff Thetford, I would probably avoid the Heartlands and Sword Coast North and Moonsea North in favour of more easterly and southerly sites. 
+_>3)
The Snowflake Mountains in eastern Amn or the Orsraun Mountains in Turmish if you want to keep it close to the Sword Coast, though I'd likely be looking to the Copper Mountains nigh Murghôm or the Smoking Mountains or nigh Ulgarth, myself. 
+_>4)
To put it in the areas I called out as likely avoiding (2#, above), I'd need to revamp the dwarven clan lore in Dwarrowdeep to match some of the lost and fallen dwarf clans of the Realms I mentioned in DWARVES DEEP.

+_> [@] Jergal likes them, though he likes being mysterious and the monks are about quelling all that's mysterious. Kelemvor doesn't hate them, he regards them as his foes because they seek to understand death and so master it, rather than in leaving death to its deity: him.

?_> [@] Could Leira use her warlock’s to discredit and humiliate the other gods? By pretending to be another god to the warlock and having that warlock perform opposite the deity’s desires? 
+_> [@] Leira is one of the few (Realms) deities who will, in disguise, be a patron to warlocks for such deceitful purposes. Most deities are served directly by clerics and paladins as classed characters, and seek to sway others through manifestations and their priesthoods.

Wed Jun 29 15:35:00 (Amaunator, Netheril, Time of Troubles, the Realms)

?_> [@] [@] If you have the time Mr.Greenwood, So the Avatar series states Ao changed how worship worked in that the Gods now needed their worshipers to draw power and exist. Which implies that the gods didn't always need that worship but just craved it 
?_> [@] [@] Is it true that they didn't always need it? 
+_> [@] [@] No. See these May 28/22 tweets:
Rockhound: "When the Time of Troubles ended, Ao declared that from then on the gods would serve their worshippers – and wither and die without their belief. If that wasn't the case before then, how could Amaunator die of abandonment after the  
+_> [@] [@] fall of Netheril?"
Me:
That WAS the case before then.
It's ALWAYS been the case in the Realms.
That declaration by Ao was a mark of how little Ao knew and understood the Realms, and was an "blind men and the elephant" in-joke by the staff designers and writers of the time.

+_> [@] The rates can be high in bad winters or when diseases spread. The game gives us a skewed view of "easy" availability of magic, but yes: even the temples of evil deities look after their neighbours; if trouble comes to their doors, they want support, not ready foes.

Fri Nov 18 06:39:40 (Forgotten Realms)

?_>Here is a story about the first time I met [@] . 🧵 [:] 
?_>In another lifetime, I was an editor for Wizards of the Coast. I worked mostly on Eberron but also some on Forgotten Realms. At the time, I had just written my first book, THE GOD CATCHER, due to come out the next year. I was also (spoiler) a few months from being laid off. 
?_>Anyway, Gen Con is approaching and my boss realizes I've never been. It is my turn therefore to go and represent the novels team. And hey, fun idea, why don't I shadow [@] and write something for the website about it!? 
?_>HAHAHA COOL COOL JUST HANG OUT WITH ED GREENWOOD, NO BIGGIE. 
?_>I got laid off before I could write up that something for the website. But two things I remember:
Ed was exceptionally kind and fun to talk to, something that has continued to be true as long as I've known him.
Everyone thought I was an intern or in marketing. 
?_>(I have a marketing face or something, I used to get this a lot.)
And I would smile and say no, I'm an editor. And every time, Ed would leap in and say "And she's an author!" 
?_>See, I could not make myself say that. My book wasn't out. I didn't feel legitimate. I get a paycheck for editing--that was real--but the novel felt like something I shouldn't talk about. It wasn't even out.
Ed was not going to let me hide my light under a bushel though. 
?_>He told me I NEEDED to say I was a writer. I needed to own it. That I'd written a great book and that more than anyone else I needed to be loud about it and proud of myself.
So I started to say it. 
?_>It was kind of scary in a weird way. I think I grew up in a situation where being proud of things you could do meant you were identifying the targets for other people to go after. I still sometimes don't quite trust I'm not setting myself up.

?_> [@] Hey Ed! If someone tried to pry after whatever Elminster had been reading in Candlekeep after his departure, would the scribes tell him about it? Would he send them an amusing or admonishing reminder about prying into the affairs of old wizards? 
+_> [@] The scribes never share what others have been reading (the best way to try to find out? Spy on which books and scrolls are out of the stacks), nor permit scrying within Candlekeep (the wards block spying from outside).
And yes, he would. ;} Like me, El has no secrets.

Why are archliches "good"? Every other arch-X is just a stronger version of X, archdruid, archmage, archangel, archdevil. 
+_> [@] Yes, I coined "archlich" when I created them (for my Spelljammer supplement, Lost Ships) in response to a specific TSR staff request to create a good lich. They were supposed to be stronger than other liches (except for the oddly named demi-liches), but got nerfed.

?_> [@] Or do the mages aren't as powerful as I thought they would be?In the novel written by Mr.Salvatore "In Sylvan Shadow",over a hundred elves defeat almost five thousand humanoids,would Myth Dannor simply be overrun by Simbian mercenaries? 
+_> [@] Scattered "undercover" (plainclothes) among the mercenaries are many Zhentarim mages. They drop back out of combat when warrior mercs aren't facing elf mages, wait for an elf mage to hurl spells, then pounce (outnumbering the elf as much as possible to overwhelm).

If you want more of a free hand to "fill in the blanks" yourself, 4e. Whereas 5e is painting in the gaps.

?_> [@] Hello! Please could you tell me if there are any earth motes floating around/above Waterdeep? 
+_> [@] There are not. The Mage of Waterdeep and the Lords like to keep the airspace clear (and the noble houses and guilds would all want to control a mote, against their rival houses and guilds). There WAS a cloud castle recently (see DEATH MASKS and STORM KING'S THUNDER).

?_> [@] I have not! I am relatively new to the realms and only just finished Death Masks after reading Blackstaff Tower (2008), so I've been wondering what happened in-between
Maybe Blackstaff will be by my next stop, but it takes place much earlier, in Khelben's lifetime? 
+_> [@] Yes. Some scenes in the novel are circa 451 DR, and the latest-chronology scenes in BLACKSTAFF are set in 1374 DR.

?_>It’s #WaterdeepWednesday y’all! My players have invaded Gralhund Villa. Wish them luck!  waterdeep #dungeonsanddragons [:] 
+_> [@] If they'd posed as limners and plaisterers (painters and plasterers) the invasion could have been a stroll. And slopbuckets of paint are killer weapons vs. nobles. ;}

?_> [@] What relationship might Shar and Auril have, if any? Cooperation, at times? Competition? Indifference? 
?_> [@] [@] The fate of Toril might be decided by your answer, the stakes are grave. 
+_> [@] Heh. Always are.
Shar and Auril may occasionally end up trying to accomplish the same (often destructive) thing, but aren't allies and don't work together.
Auril regards herself as active, a creator, and Shar as seeking oblivion. Shar sees Auril as a foolish upstart.

Take your pick: Aerammarglas, Glazalarlam, Imrylgloth, Ralaglaud, Voarulglammandar.

?_> [@] Excellent. I have that book. 
?_> [@] [@] Hey [@] how about also the Doomvault under Thaymount, referred to in your latest awesome book on the Land of the Red Wizards? I'm curious to know if that's ever been mapped out/designed  
+_> [@] [@] Oh, yes, it's part of the classic Dead In Thay adventure. (Brought to life by Scott Fitzgerald Gray.)

?_> [@] Ed of the Greenwood, our scholars once again worry about evil alliances.
Yan C Bin and Lissa'aere both have Chan as their primary enemy--are they working together? If so, who calls the shots? How do they navigate the rivalry between Yan C Bin and Pazuzu? 
+_> [@] They aren't working together. Such an alliance would be VERY formidable. Yet the nature of the entities involved would make it unlikely. For which everyone else should be very thankful. ;}

Things I've agreed not to talk about. ;}
However, those who were at Milwaukee-era GenCons and played in certain charity D&D sessions set in the Realms encountered some "futuristic" tech while adventuring.

?_> [@] I'm reading Death Masks right now (which is a wonderful book by the way, I adore Laeral), and I was wondering what ever happened to Laeral's daughter? Krehlan Arunsun's twin sister. It seems weird she doesn't even have a name 
+_> [@] The reason there's so little in print about her is: NDAs galore. Sorry.
There Were Plans and they may still come to pass.
Glad you're enjoying Death Masks!

?_> [@] [@] It's so very nice to get to know little bits about the interactions behind the creation process of the products we know for all those long years 
Thanks again!
In one of my old campaigns I read the entry of the Elder Elemental God several times before going for Ghaunadaur. 
+_> [@] [@] My pleasure. In the old days, before NDAs got written so broadly, creatives talked back and forth a lot when they were working in the same settings. By phone or postcard or letter (sometimes couriered) or even teleprinter, as email didn't exist (or was military-restricted).
