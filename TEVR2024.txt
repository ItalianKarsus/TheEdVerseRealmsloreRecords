I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous, Ed! Even the ancient Greeks and Chinese and other cultures from 2,000 years ago had mathematics beyond that. Surely, with how well-traveled El is and how long his life has been, he would've taken the time to learn?
Moreover, how could Toril possibly be at the level of development that it's at without higher math? At the barest minimum, merchants would know more than basic algebra and arithmetic- wouldn't he have had to deliberately ignore that knowledge? Perhaps I'm missing something here.
Yes, you're missing that Toril has DIFFERENT math from our real world (math is a language, not an absolute), and that El has never had to learn it
Merchants deal in weight and volume and margins and return, none of which requires "our" specific algebra.
It's a fallacy to view "progress" as something inevitable or always in one direction or one rate, from the old to the new. Or that a different world 'must' advance as we did. That's where the worldbuilding "think outside real-world Earth" comes in.

Oh wise sage, help us ring in the new year with your wisdom
What's the distinction between Faerunian pipeweed and Maztican tobacco?
Inquiring scholars wish to know
Two differences: the climate (colder and drier on Faerûn) while the leaves grow, and the drying process (more sun-baking on sun-heated rocks in Maztica), leading to a sharper taste for tobacco versus pipeweed. Also, some hin dry their pipeweed on leaves and roots of other plants, to impart flavors (in Faerûn, not in Maztica).
Glorious, but not a drastic difference in terms of the plants themselves?
Aye, not drastic. Same plant, but different prep, so (slightly) different end taste to the smoke. You can sure tell the difference side by side, but it's all desirable for your pipe bowl. The drier Maztican burns MUCH better tight-rolled (cigar) w/less smoke.

Festivals or "year-days," for choice, and colloquially "upon the feast of Greengrass" for all of the celebrations that aren't holy days for just one deity, or allied group of deities like the Triad.

any forgotten realms lore I should know about here?
Sure. You’re looking at (left to right):
Andred Kuroone, a merchant based in Zazesspur, who sells “thael leaf” (the dried leaves of a plant sold to be added to either temple incense or pipeweed, to flavor the smoke inhaled with an almond-plus-herbs (think amaretto and roast nuts, but not sweet) among other herbs, spices, and dried foods (apricots, et al).
Lurandural Veltree, a (kneeling) half-elf representative of The Halanthor, a local merchants’ guild. He’s holding a forouge or “test pipe” for sampling the smoke of inhaled or  suffused sales goods. Its odd shape is due to it being carved to resemble a stirge skull (a common style from the 1200s DR onwards). The slate on the ground is his, used for scribbling down trade deals on the spot. He’s here at the invitation of the priestess, and is  awaiting a sample of the mix Galannavruk is preparing.
Jhalanavress Tanthavur, a priestess of Waukeen, in “everyday” temple wear, who’s smoking the thael leaf the merchants are trying to sell her, and evidently enjoying it. This shipment of thael will be ground up  and added to temple braziers, not smoked in pipes. Jhalanavress holds the rank of Preceptress in her temple, equivalent to “chatelaine” of a castle; she’s in charge of all the lay temple staff and the underpriests, and the grounds and fabric (walls, roof, plumbing structure) of the temple
Orstrar Galannavruk, a (sitting) second “dried sundries” merchant working with Andred Kuroone; he’s the senior partner and the main “coin mountain” of the partnership, but leaves much of the negotiating to the more charismatic and younger
Andred. He’s currently blowing some crumbled thael into an incense mixer (the chase-decorated globe) the priestess has loaned him, to mix it and present her with the result for her to inhale and approve or disapprove of. (She’s going to enthusiastically approve.)
This scene is taking place in a back temple yard (between the rear wing of the holy house and its stables) of The High Holy House of Coin, a recently-founded temple of Waukeen in northeasternmost Scornubel, in the late 1490s DR.
Kuroone and Galannavruk have trekked. straight from Triboar, and are dressed accordingly.
Great illustration, BTW!

Are there any particular culture in Faerun and beyond where basket hilts have caught on? Sembia seems to like it's rapiers.
Basket hilts are most common in Chessenta, and from there have spread to the Vilhon, Sembia, and easternmost Tethyr. You'll also see them in "melting pot mixes" like Scornubel, Waterdeep, and the Border Kingdoms.

Hi . REPLY-TO-TWITTER
I was reading up on FR lore and came across Weaveghosts. In BG3 you have the option to let Gale blow himself up with the Netherese Orb to destroy the brain. Could he become a weaveghost or even be resurrected after that? Or does the nature of the Orb prevent it?
He could be, but it would be up to Mystra and/or Azuth. (There wouldn't be enough left of him for him to act, or even be aware.)
That's what I was thinking, he'd be fragmented. But that should mean a powerful enough mage like Elminster could make him whole again right?
Physically whole, yes. Mentally stable, yes. However, young memories the "mage like Elminster" isn't privy to (from before the restored being started using the Weave/casting spells): no. So the restorer often substitutes their own moral compass.

Could you give me some tips or ideas for a campaign that will take place in the time of troubles and that is not directly linked to the tablets of fate?
Thanks!
Sure.
First: protect home and hearth. It was a time of widespread tumult and strife, so any place or people dear to the PCs may need protection from all manner of villainous opportunists, raiding monsters, etc.
Second: aid law and order: help protect temples, local rulers, guard against brigandry on trade roads, and contain monster outbreaks (raiding out of mountain caverns or dungeons, perhaps driven forth by foes or fear).
Third: Recover important holy relics or magic items that have been lost or looted.
Fourth: Find and bring back or protect vitally important people (such as brilliant inventors Gondite priests want kept safe and alive).
Fifth: foil rebellions or assassination attempts or invasions that have been readied before the Time of Troubles, but are launched to take advantage of the chaos.
Sixth: for bad guys: go on a thieving spree that exploits the widespread chaos. Perhaps in desperation: get  badly needed components or riches to buy lives (creditors will kill you if you don't pay them off) or working as hirelings for someone trying to assemble a magic item or make an artifact that may quell the chaos or defend an area.
There: some beginnings! Enjoy!

Back in 2003 I wrote official 3E conversions of a bunch of 2E Realms dragons that . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. wrote. The Wizards links eventually faded, but I've found them on the Web Archive. Here's Galadaeros, a copper dragon who watches over an adventuring company.
I’ve had this mag for a while and now I been commissioned to write a #Dungeoncraft . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Forgotten Realms adventure with The Sunset Flame in it! Part of ‘The Forgotten Wyrms’ effort by Dos Ligas Adventeiros, D&D Org play Brazil!
Well that's interesting timing! Good luck on your adventure design! :D
I read over all the sources I could find including this article, Dragons of Faerun and Fizban’s. I’m sure there could be more tidbits that Elminster . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. himself may likely have. The article is just chock-filled with adventure opportunities.
Sure! What would you like to know? (Opens coat, leans in)
I've got your secret lore right here 
For instance, Galaderos recently acquired (from unknown sources) an enchanted human-palm-sized glowing cube of rock crystal that can cast three hypnotic pattern spells per day. He uses it to throw up temporary traps in his lair, when intruders enter.
Ooh. Wow! Thank you!
My pleasure!
Oh, and his lair has a reverse gravity trap, but it's stationary and not under the control of Galadaeros (beyond fencing it off and warning folks about it protections he removes for intruders, of course).

Makes me wonder how many Lord Bladderblats were assassinated whilst in the Privy by shapeshifted assASSins.
Care to comment, . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. something hushed up in the Realms, so word won't get around and encourage hirings of shapeshifting slayers.
Dozens before 1339 DR, when the trap (water-filled letter-S-on-its-back, to quell odors) was invented, and the "long drop" you see here got superceded.
Traps are found in grand buildings across the Realms in the 1400s, emptied (by a hapless servant in a little chamber below the garderobe) via removal of a plug at an S "bottom," into a carry-urn.
The trap is then refilled with fresh scented water through the seat.

Strahd is nowhere NEAR the first vampire. That's PR. No one knows the true origins of vampires; that's lost in the mists of time. So, VERY long ago.

Feb 05 21:19 (Realmslore)
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. got another query for you. When discussing those with "The Gift" for arcane magic, what happens when someone without The Gift tries to cast a spell? Does it not work because the weave doesn't listen to them, or because they are unconsciously doing it wrong, or what?
It doesn't work because they don't have the mental knack of visualizing the effect (& precise target/location/extent, if applicable) AND symbols formed in their mind by the somatic component AND connection to the Weave. You must do all three simultaneously to cast.
How does one forge a connection to the Weave, is that part of Wizard training or is it completely inborn?
The Gift" is the term used to describe those who can innately access the Weave (though some have a triggering event, and can't do it at birth or in youth). Magic items provide that connection for the wielder. Training can enhance the ability to access and work with the Weave.
If this is the case, explain 3e Use Magic Device skill, which allowed non-casters to activate magical items and/or cast spells from Scrolls and Wands without necessary caster levels. ? As has been the case from the very beginning of D&D in the Realms, magic items provide conduits to the Weave so that their wielder need not have the Gift (unless nature the specific magic item prohibits).
The skill you refer to IS the necessary 3-fold mental knack of casting.

Hey Ed, what is the traditional condiment one would enhance their dragon meat with? A sauce, perhaps? Just salt and pepper?
Depends on the dragon. Wine AND spirit -based (a mix, with herbs, too) marinades "make" most dragon dishes. Tamarind sauces and mustards are sometimes added at the "eating from your plate" stage, and soups such as leek and turtle may also be used as sauces.
What kind of monster eats a dragon?
I mean that in an outraged kind of way
Some orc and hobgoblin tribes hunted and ate young dragons as both a rite of passage and for the meat, which they find very tasty.
Human merchants daring to trade with orcs have eaten dragon served to them to be polite, or because they didn't know what they were being served.

How does dragon meat taste, Ed?
Depends on the dragon, of course. And their age. Hatchlings of all non-aquatic species taste rather like the fine white meat of a well-done pork chop, the bit just before the fat rind.
As they grow older, they taste more like alligator (the tail meat). And then vary.
I have to ask did you think about this response on the spot, or was this something that was kinda canon already or has come up before?
It has come up MANY times before. There was lore about this in the 1986 Realms turnover to TSR. (Eating dragons, and their eggs, was a well-established part of the original D&D game.)

They are furred like moth wings (fine hairs), but this is thick and glossy enough along the tops of the wings, and over the muscles where the wings join their torsos, that it's like a real-world chinchilla fur coat (or coat collar).

Why can't a deity just give the Gift to a mortal? I mean, it doesn't sound like it would be difficult for Mystra to just give the ability to wield magic to someone.
A deity CAN just give the Gift to a mortal. They very seldom do, as Ao frowns on this (he wants to avoid an "arms race" among the deities, as such things never end well.)

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I seriously doubt I’ll get a reply, but 30 years on from my D&D days I’m doing an update of Eveningstar project as a hobby for myself. I wondered if you could give me some historical background that’s not in the public domain? Thank you for years of fun in the past
Turbine did an update of Eveningstar some years back that updated it and gave some back lore. I'm currently running the Haunted Halls circa 1499 DR, but can't share yet as we're not done. So in a month or two?

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hi there! Sorry to bother you, but I met quite a conundrum and I hoped you could help me. I am currently running a commoner/giftless campaign set in FR, and I kinda wanted to give the players the option to upgrade their commoners to full player characters at the end.
Many (more than a third) of all sentient beings in the Realms who have the Gift didn't exhibit it at all at birth, or youth, until an event "awakened" it.
Many such events involve a being getting touched directly by magic for the first time, such as getting  caught in the area of effect of a spell (needn't be a combat spell, could be light or faerie fire), handling a magic item or touching an artifact, stepping through a ward they may not even know is there (i.e. across a temple doorway), and so on.
Even if they  got tested for the Gift when young, and the test showed nothing at all, that doesn't mean they didn't have it, or wouldn't later get it. Brains change and develop throughout life.
Explains why my fighter might pick up some wizard levels after traveling with one for a while.
Indeed. And every time the party cleric casts Bless on fellow party members, there's a chance one or more of them will manifest their Gift. They not even know it at the time.
Are there any lifestyles or practices that might increase one's chances of developing the Gift?
Handling magic items (in an armoury) or holy items in a temple, working with wizards or sorcerers, exploring old tombs and ruins that might have wards, being test subjects for spellcastings (especially shapeshifting or translocation magics), and so on.
How would someone get tested for the Gift? Can one do that without magical aid?
In the Realms, the clergy of local temples or shrines usually test for the Gift (using cantrips/orizons, so it is a magical test). Sometimes mages test others by teaching them a "safe" cantrip that has very simple casting and seeing if anything happens.

Feb 08 16:27 (Realmslore)
Could emotions such as great stress, anxiety or trauma (or maybe even some great bliss, to escape the cliché), awaken someone's Gift?
Oh, yes. Many have awakened their Gift in great grief, or rage, because they or their community has suffered great loss.
Such as teens who've spied on a local wizard casting spells, and when their village gets raided, furiously try to duplicate that spellcasting--and it works!
Sounds almost like magic spreads like a virus. I wonder if most people could eventually cast spells if you soaked them in enough magic.
Heh. It DOES sound like that, doesn't it? Be careful with what you wonder; certain Torilian deites are listening

Hey Ed! Great answer. How do the differences between wizards and sorcerers come into play here regarding The Gift?
Both wizards and sorcerers have the Gift (the ability to personally access the Weave without needing a magic item or the favour of a deity to do it), but sorcerers learn to spontaneously channel the energies into magical effects, whereas wizards learn procedures  (= spells) that produce known magical effects, and sometimes tinker with spells to modify the effects, and experiment until they've crafted new spells.
How do Bards factor into this then? 
Are they also born with the gift but are merely magical dilettantes that never bothered to foster their gift properly?
Bards (the character class, not all minstrels) have the Gift.
There are many ways to use the Gift. The game gives us rules for those considered playable character classes. There are also many "wild talents" (just plain folks but can do ONE magical thing (&have never been trained)
Does this mean that arcana clerics don't have the gift, but actually are given the effects of the gift by a deity?
No, arcana clerics have the Gift. Not all clerics, of every sort, do. (But many do.) Regardless, they all customarily get their spells from their deities (or servitors of those deities).
Hey Ed! With some Rogues being able to use normally Wizard only items does this mean that Mystra sometimes*really* appreciates high quality showmanship? :)
Unless their specific nature dictates otherwise, magic items provide conduits to the Weave so that their wielder need not have the Gift. Rogues who can use "wizard only" items have the dexterity, attention to detail, and (especially) concentration to do so.

And now onto another high of the past week, I’ll be guesting on a very special show called #LegacyOfWorlds over on . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Prerecording these episodes was such a blast, I know you’ll love em.
Join our stellar crew while we cross the multiverse and celebrate #DnD50!
Special thanks to my fellow cast . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. and . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. for welcoming me with open arms, as well as the entire crew. (I can’t wait to watch and see what shenanigans . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. and . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. got up to too!)
Anyway, no spoilers about my character— that would be telling. But damn do I want to tell!
For now, you can read more about the show here: http://yawningportal.dnd.wizards.com/blog/celebrate
Note a previous version of this thread somehow didn’t mention . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. and I have no desire to be cursed to be a frog. Serves me right for making socials posts on the train, honestly.
By now you must know . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. won’t curse you to be a frog. He’d use true polymorph to turn you into a clam, and then he’d drop a meteor swarm on you!
THAT IS WORSE KEITH. Please tell me how you see that’s worse, I’m scared
No, no, I'd do it GENTLY
A gentle METEOR SWARM? H-how? How does that— maybe I don’t want to know
One whose effects are precisely located so as to just scorch from afar. Like toasting a marshmallow as opposed to immolating it, or vaporizing it in an explosion
It sears GENTLY.
I think that Elminster could definitely have a “gentle spellcasting” metamagic option. When you’re struck by a gentled spell, you don’t actually KNOW how much damage you take. It surrounds you like a warm rain of twinkling stars. . and then a kitten sneezes and you drop dead.
I feel like there's an option here for a slowed spellcasting effect too, allowing damage to be spread out over several turns (without holding concentration). You know so someone has the chance to observe their slow singing over 30 seconds.
Or is that too much? singeing. Autocorrect turned that into a musical somehow 
I agree. Any mage who's used a spell a time or six over the years will have the "feel" to tinker with it, and slowing or gentling effects is easy (you just cut back on your pull on the Weave). It's when you try to power up known spells that things get dangerous.

HI Ed! Wouldn't it be in Mystra's best interest if there was no *the gift* barrier for people to cast magic? Or is there a simple reason like the weave not currently being strong enough?
It would be in Mystra's best interest, but the world doesn't work to serve anyone's best interest.
It's nothing to do with the strength of the Weave (which is all the energies of the world). Rather, it's about the aptitudes of individual entities.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Well met, good sir! I am reading and enjoying Elminster's Forgotten Realms, but I have a question. Pray tell, how does one pronounce the elven word "slaugh"? Is it slaw or sloff, or something else entirely?
Slaugh” (a disparaging Elvish term for orcs; the transliteration is “mud-wallowing dogs”) is pronounced “Sull-LOC” (the emphasis syllable is almost the word “lock,” but don’t click-close the K, leave it open and hanging as if the word is unfinished/bitten off)

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. hey! I read Elminster's Daughter.
Squeaking, fluttering gorcraws" remind me of the gorscraw Dove was plucking in Spellfire. Are they the same bird?
Also, is there anything on the greenfin fish in Elminster's pond or rainbow-fin fish in Haelithtorntowers?
One answer at a time
No.
Gorcraws are like (usually; some grow bigger) sparrow-sized crows: they’d caw loudly if they were larger, but instead mainly squeak.
Gorscraws are like plump, well-fed grouse or pheasant: a dim-witted “good eating” bird that nests  on the ground.
Both throughout Heartlands and Sword Coast. The name “Gorcraw” originated in Sembia, and the name “Gorscraws” in Tethyr, and one may well have been carried by caravan merchants and misapplied to “another” bird.

Ok, so my concern about "Vressa's Sweep Begone" is that "southfront Saerdoun Street 3 doors west of Thunderstaff Way" is also "Tiger's Eye" in Dragon Heist (https://aidedd.org/atlas/index.php?map=W&l=1&p=Tiger%27s%20Eye), according to me.
Did I miss something?
Can you give me more details about this location?
Sure. This three-floors-plus attic timber-and-stucco old building with a new (three summers back) tile roof is a former pipeleaf shop with offices above and owner’s dwelling suite on the top floor. In 1494 DR the shop closed, and was converted into business  offices like the floor above.
The building changed owners, and the current owner (a gnome widower by the name of Hardyn Glorjarn, an investor and wagon fleet owner) lives on the top floor. Vressa got the “back” (larger) ground floor office, Velardar Vincent 
Trench got the front one, and the four upstairs offices stayed in the same hands: Erro Alhandrar’s Nets (half-elf importer of knotted fishing nets from Sheirtalar and the Tashalar); Demra Samdro’s Best Beds (outcast female dwarf retired adventurer, using an  assumed name, and now making and selling grand beds that disassemble for easy movement and installation); Laskalan’s Lamps and Lanterns (fussy old man who fixes and sells new lamps and lanterns and their wicks and oil and candles; an importer, not a maker [his secret is that he adds tiny “secret compartments” in his lanterns for such things as keys, lockpicks, and knife blades]); and Tantra Jaressra’s Fine Gowns (importer, maker, alterer, and cleaner of high-fashion gowns for feast and revel wear; Tantra is a  gorgeous human female who isn’t a lady of pleasure, but is a superb actress who hires herself out as “arm candy” for an evening, at high rates).
Many buildings in Waterdeep are like this: multiple tenants and uses, not this building is one person’s home or shop.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. how do you pronounce baator? Or is there nine dialects of pronunciation? 
I've always pronounced it as bah-tor, and heard mizoras be-ah-tor in BG3.
Across the multiverse, there are many pronounciations, but "BAH-tor" is almost universally heard in the Realms.
Arls Beatorh ("Bee-AH-tor") is the name of a merchant of Athkatla who infamously drowned in a vat of his own wine. Possibly with help.

Beautiful stringy starter.going to mix it w basically doubling the recipe with more flour yeast water a dash of olive oil. work it until it’s smooth n stringy. Rest for an hour(it’s cold so more than that) more working and rest for another hour. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Form, dust off the flour. Grease and cover for 1-2 hours more. Let’s hope it rises again 🫣 then we’ll bake and make the spread for the spreadbread. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Drizzle with water. Now to bake. Then we’ll roast garlic, make compound butter, fry tomato paste and make the spreadbread. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Bread is done, now need it to crisp. Garlic is roasted and mashed into the butter. We are almost done. #cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Compound butter. Keeping it soft. Fried and slightly blackened tomato paste for smokiness, spices and seasoning and the smoked sardine spread. Now waiting for crispened bread (it gotten too soft in humidity after cooking) Spreadbread’s almost here #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Test with without butter, salt no salt, as is and fried. Let’s see which one is the way to go. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms - Spreadbread
Tasting, frying to order #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Bread is good. Spread is good. Spreadbread - a beloved tavern food that goes well with cold ale- another recipe from Tethyr is tested. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. is this anywhere near your Spreadbread from Volo’s BG2? I kinda like it fried spread side down better than just butter and spread on fresh bread.
Yes, it is! Love the look of this in your pics! Yummm

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Mr Greenwood, I have a question if you have a minute?
Are there any persons in the realms beyond God's who can concentrate on two spells at once?
In my headcanon, Laeral Silverhand can as she is a chosen and so in tune with the weave.
Cheers.
Many individuals can concentrate on two spells at once: all of those with psionics, all Weavemasters (incl. all of the Chosen), and all who can use "hanging" spells (magics cast in the past that haven't "gone off" yet).
However, no mortal can actually CAST two  spells at once. Certain individuals CAN unleash more than one spell (or spell-like magical effect) in the same round, thanks to their innate or acquired capabilities.
An example: From Elminster's current character sheet (source: Wizards of the Coast): 
Note that this ability overcomes the usual limitation on spellcasters of only casting one spell in a turn, unless one spell is a bonus action and the other is a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action; so El can cast a “normal” spell and a Master of Magic spell in a turn, but cannot also cast a 1-action-casting-time cantrip in that turn to launch three magics. However, in a turn in which he doesn’t use this Master of Magic ability, El can cast a bonus action spell and a 1-action-casting-time cantrip

I’d love to ask . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. whether the current incarnation of Mystra still has any of the mortal Midnight left within her, or has she been completely subsumed.
Current Mystra" still has Midnight within her.
That's actually Mystra's greatest strength: the mental toughness/sanity she has from her memories of her various mortal lifetimes (different views and perspectives).
So she is there!! Why does Mystra never change regardless of who else is 'in there with her' then? Is it more like she has their memories now a la mindflayer, or how does it work?
Mystra is the Weave, so it's like having every magic-wielding entity in your head at once. "You" would get lost and submerged in the shouting flood if you didn't have an incredible will and concentration: and THAT is the "never-changing" Mystra the wider world sees.

So for all intents and purposes, Midnight is no more then? Could she ever go back to just being herself? Ps: thank you for taking the time to answer! It's so interesting to know
Traducir post
Mystra COULD send Midnight back into the world in a new body, but it would be as an avatar of herself, because the goddess would not, under any circumstances, deny anyone their memories of being touched by magic. That's her core.
However, when I type these  words, I DON'T mean Mystra would put Midnight back on Toril as a mighty, fighting, powerful god in Midnight's body. Not that sort of avatar. I mean that Midnight would know at the back of her mind that she was part of Mystra.
And though such a return is  unlikely to happen, Mystra could do it for two good reasons: to give herself another roving Weave anchor, and if she ever wanted to birth new Chosen, setting Midnight up to be their literal mother.
As for the father?
We'll have to leave that for a tale.

Could someone from our world, get into a moral debate with Shar and warp her mind to realize she's been creating new things trying to warp creation?
Oh, yes. However, she already knows that, and long ago rationalized for herself that the end justifies the means, and as long as it's HER creating, that's fine, because (she thinks) she controls what she creates, and can "unmake" it at will. She's wrong, of course. lmao! sounds a bit like Arcturus Mengsk too or modern real life bad folks 
Since I created Shar, I have always thought of her as someone who sees reality differently from everyone else.
It's the only tenable explanation (from a relatively sane mortal POV) for many of the things she's said and done.
She's a "mortal loss and despair" junkie.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hello Ed, I have a question that I’m not sure if you could help with. I am basing a new character on being a descendant of Otiluke from Greyhawk. There is very little lore about Otiluke. Do you know more on his lore? And do you know how he came to be known in Faerun?
Otiluke (who, sadly, is no longer with us) covertly visited Toril several times to visit with Elminster. He became more widely known after his demise, when Mordenkainen was in Toril being nursed back to sanity by Elminster.
What lore are you most interested in?
I play a former apprentice of Otiluke in Lord Gosumba's Greyhawk games, Rhavalantar, a member of the Two-Drink Minimum adventuring band.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I have wondered for a long time if Elminster could use High Magic. Since he was involved in creating Myth Drannor Mythal and creating near-like Mythal wards over Hellgate keep. Not to mention his close relationship with Mystra and Srinshee.
Yes, he can. However, as a Weavemaster, he can now achieve the same magical results without the High Magic castings.
Thank you for your answer! I appreciate that. And I had never expected that I would get that fast.
Could you also shed some light on who else besides El is a Weavemaster? I would expect Srinshee before her demise and Larloch (if he is still "alive" somewhere). Maybe Ioulaum too?
Mystra's Chosen and Azuth's Chosen and the Srinshee are Weavemasters.
NOT Larloch, and not at all Ioulaum; his brain has gone in other directions, and like Karsus, he fought to conquer the Weave, not become one with it.
I see and understand. So, Weavemaster subtly works over Wave and uses it to alter flow rather than wrest and bend it to their will (Larloch, Ioulaum). What about Manshoon before he lost his chosen status in your Spellstorm novel? Was he capable of using the Wave as Weavemaster?
No, he'd never learned how. To do so, you have to surrender to Mystra or Azuth, and they show you how. "Mystra is the Way," literally.
Manshoon consistently either defied or betrayed Mystra.

Purebloods are the most human-seeming yuan-ti, and so are most like humans in their eating capacity. However, like some serpents, they can temporarily unhinge their jaws to swallow things that wouldn’t otherwise fit, but if

Hi, I've seen you answered Yuan Ti questions in the past.
I am wondering if a non pureblood Yuan Ti with a snake tail cound even use Disgues Self to look like they are having 2 legs
Is the tail a leg because they stand on it or just a continuation of their spine?
Yuan Ti can use their tails like legs (and swing them as bludgeoning weapons, and use them as rudders when swimming or leaping/falling), so yes, they could use Disguise Self in this manner. Practise (cast spell, move while "wearing" it) will make the deception better.

If you don’t mind I have been wondering if it would be possible to play as a Yuan-Ti abomination I just like snakes
Certainly. You'd have unique powers, so the DM would have to prepare a campaign accordingly.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. what's the drow word for "moon", or the rough equivalent of it? alvassun (from: silver-light: alva = silver hue + ssussun = light, brightness) that’s so pretty 😭 thank you so much!
My pleasure!
Surface elves of Faerûn, by contrast, usually say "teu" for both moon and the hue of silver. :}

I get the eytmology (and the real world significance given the moon reflects the sun) but it's very funny that the word for moon has "sun" in it.
It is, but remember that the moon is the only "sun" that most drow (raiding the surface from the Underdark) ever see.
This idea (but not the actual word) came from Gary Gygax, who gave us the drow as D&D depicts them.
So that the night is their "day"? And they never go out during the day?
Underdark-dwelling drow raid the Realms Above (the surface world) by night; they find the light of the sun blinding, and its brightness robs them of cover, whereas they function quite well in conditions surface dwellers find dark.

Looking for tips on encouraging (either through rewards or mechanics) RP in TTRPG sessions. Inspiration is meh. Ideas? Does RP and a good story fit in OSR?I like story with my crawl.
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I would love your thoughts if you get a minute.
Sure. The "brute force" way of doing this is to have talking items. Haunted, that is, and with unfinished business that they want the living (the PCs) to do for them. Endless source of not just prodding, but lore drops for the DM, and twisted rumors. And they can ask pointed  questions at strategic moments to push players into moral choices. Example: "So, do you kill him, and add one more trophy to your acclaim? Or do the right thing, and let him live? Or IS it the right thing? Do you ever consider such things at all, Othmorr the Great Hero or do you just butcher your way through life? How will it feel, when some other dunderhead butcher cuts you down? What price your trophy wall THEN?" and so on.
As I said, brute force, but it can get the roleplaying going. Nothing more startling than a carrion crawler  pleading for its life. Or a talking sword that moans, "Not through the heart AGAIN? Whatever happened to diplomacy?"
Roleplaying is the FUN in the game.
Three are great, . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. , and I thank you! Items and NPCs forcing RP is a fun thing I can get into. I just imagine a rapier that critiques swordplay, or a pair of boots that play music when the wearer fights or flees
We were doing the equivalent of "Brave Sir Robin ran away!" at our gaming table (boardgames, before D&D) before Monty Python was, as we got it from the same place the Pythons did: the Goon Show.

Mar 12 11:13 (Realmslore)
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I'm working on a forgotten realms mystery/adventure that's inspired by the stories of Livermore PA and Centralia, PA. I have a village name and a marsh/forest terrain setting, but no place to put it in the faerun map. Any suggestions for good locations?
Sure. Livermore was repeatedly flooded until it was abandoned (so the US Army Engineers could “fix” the river responsible), and the upper reaches of the west branch of the Thornwash, that flows south to empty into the Lake of Steam at Ankhapur fit that very well.
Centralia is abandoned due to a coal-seam fire beneath it that has burned for years. There are places in Threskel today, due south of Mount Thulbane, where the same thing is happening, and there are “Baking Rocks” (hot rocky terrain) and “Forging Rifts” (open  cracks in the rock where lava seethes, and brave gnomes and dwarves come to work metals in the heat).
Now, if you want those two conditions in the same village, so in the same place, that’s much harder. You’ll have to go all the way east to southern Semphar  for that. To the westernmost branch of the Goldenflow, where it tumbles down out of the Raurin Alta.

Dear Mr. . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. , I have a question about the bladethirst spell from FR Adventures
Is this spell effective against creatures that can only be hit by magical weapons? Is a common dagger under this spell considered a +3 magical weapon for the spell's duration?
Yes and yes.
Those properties are the main reason for the spell's popularity.

Hey, . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I'm DMing in the Time of Troubles and a doubt came to my mind:
When a god dies (like Bane and Torm died in Tantras), does his soul go to the Fugue Planes (or Myrkul's Realm in this time) like mortals that died or it goes somewhere else?
What about the soul of  the body they took as an Avatar?
This is one of the innate, unusual elements of godhood: there’s nothing predictable about the destination of a divine soul, or a divine-touched soul (such as the soul of a body a deity, even a demigod, has inhabited). They can appear anywhere, and go anywhere sometimes moving by what seems like instinct or deliberate will, and sometimes seemingly at random/confused. No one knows what causes them to appear or journey to a specific place, beyond the observed fact that “unfinished business” (like an undead revenant)  seems to SOMETIMES have some bearing on this.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. a question, when children die in Faerun, and they couldn't choose a Patron in life, do their souls go to the Wall of the Faithless in the City of Judgement?
No, “Faithless” are those who repudiated the gods deliberately. In the polytheistic Realms, no one has to choose a Patron. Dead infants and children drift towards the deity most often worshipped in their presence, even if they were asleep, too ill or comatose  to know what was going on around them, and so on. If the parents or family they were directly part of/spent time within venerated a specific deity or several deities, those deities would have the strongest ‘call
And didn’t Kelemvor do away with the Wall of the Faithless in the later Avatar books after he became the god of the dead? Maybe I’m misremembering?
Indeed.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. any hint on how is Laeral Silverhand handling Waterdeep politics?
Like, has the Waterdevian "Hegemony" expanded into the Wild Frontier? Are the finances doing good? Amy relevant change?
Laeral inherited a city whose finances were a shambles, thanks to her predecessor (Neverember) spending lavishly and looting treasury budgets for his own ends, as well as a city of increasing tensions due to his habit of setting Masked Lords against each other guild against guild, and trading coster against trading coster so he held the most daily on-the-ground power.
She is trying to soothe tensions, restore trust (largely by fair and open rulings, kindness, and restoring rights or privileges that had been  trampled upon). So her theme thus far has been more renewal than reaching out, aside from trying to achieve closer accord with such places as Silverymoon and Secomber (in other words, to revive the spirit of the Silver Marches if not any of its formal  existence). The finances are doing much better, as she improves tax collection but refines the tax code so residents don’t feel oppressed, and the trust is coming back far more slowly. Currently, Laeral is leaving the “fix small conspiracies and blunt the  reach of the Xanathar” to Elminster (who has achieved much by personally confronting the beholder crime lord and warning it that if it becomes too troublesome, El can and will personally destroy it, with ease—and might even make the demise "fittingly painful") and devoting herself to improving her personal relationships with Vajra (the Blackstaff), various noble houses, and specific Masked Lords and guildmasters. Her goal is not to win any popularity contests, but to make Waterdeep a happier place whose residents  residents feel like a team, who like each other’s company, and not “a nest of competing vipers,” which is what one veteran merchant called it three decades ago.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. hey just checking was Vangerdahast's sanctum in "Elminster's Daughter" the Stag Steads lodge near Mouth o' Gargoyles?
No. It was near Stag Steads, but was a place he magically shielded from discovery (and magically reshaped) after discovering it. Unbeknownst to him, part of it consisted of caverns in the depths of the King’s Forest that in ancient times were lairs for  dragons—and when Mystra’s vestige appeared in another cave, some of her “backup echoes” were in this sanctum.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. l've been thinking about the Gift with your tweets this past week, and I got to wondering: is it even possible to have a reliable method to grant the Gift? If so, has anyone figured one out yet? If not, why?
No. There is no reliable method of passing on the Gift. A tendency has been observed for parents who both have the Gift to have offspring who have a higher chance of being Gifted than the children of non-Gifted parents, with the children of unions between Gifted  and non-Gifted being “in the middle” in terms of likelihood of each of their children being Gifted.
It seems to be something beyond mortals to figure out, or control. Some have even tried such things as ongoing contact with enchanted dildoes, surgically  implanted magic items, magical undergarments, and “treatment programs” of having spells frequently cast on pregnant women and their infants, to try to make the Gift manifest more often. .but NOTHING is reliable. Mystra, Azuth, and Ao can grant the Gift, and  overwhelming one’s own blood with that of creatures whose Gift is innate (dragon’s blood) often but not always works, but nothing more is reliable.
It's obviously, after all this time and experimentation, something that can’t be “figured out,” so. .that’s why.

Mar 28 23:54 (Realmslore)
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Are there spells or other magic in the realms that deal with paternity tests, or other DNA-type tests?
Yes, but they are rare, and most clergies that know such divine spells (they are all divine, and not arcane, though some arcane spells can detect enchanted blood; for these to have any utility, the caster has to know the nature of the blood that was  there before” a suspected contact or change or event) have ethical considerations about using them.
In other words, if the requester (who must typically pay handsomely) doesn’t have a strong reason for knowing heritage/lineage/inheritance (such as a curse or nobility, or royalty) that the clergy accepts, they won’t cast such spells. If establishing paternity will prevent local feuds or mistreatment of an individual, the clergy would likely cast such a spell.

if Elminster wanted to, could he rebuild his ancient homeland the Kingdom of the Stag Athalanter? I am only curious about his former homeland.
He COULD, but it would wreak havoc in current Secomber and the lands around, and would be hollow to him: it would be a "stage set" evoking his past, not restoring it. So why harm folk now, to chase something he knows he can't get back?

Hoo boy, citizenship matters in many, many places across Faerûn, as a basis for voting, for guild membership, for preferential tax treatment in some places and land/urban real estate ownership in others; if you count towns and city states, in HUNDREDS of places.

Thank you! And that’s an interesting point. . is it maybe more common to run into shapeshifted dragons throughout?
Likely. However, most of the time, you'll never know. They don't go "breaking cover" lightly.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. ever since watching your video on iron spheres, i can't help but wonder if a drunken elminster is more or less dangerous? given the remark about pina coladas, if you are willing to answer such an admittingly silly question XD
Theoretically, more dangerous because inhibitions gone so he might "cut loose" with powerful magic more easily. However, I've never seen him drunk, just "happy," and a happy Elminster seems a lot safer than a grim one.
Should I ask him?
But as he is able to control his fertility at will, is he not able to determine if he gets drunk or not?
Likely so. Which is almost certainly why I've never seen him drunk.
Are there any characters that you find very interesting but no one has ever asks about?
Oh, yes. Though after 56 years, most of them are finally getting asked about.
People tend to start with the powerful ones, then move on to the "bad boys" and only later get around to the quiet ones. The wives and aunts and grandmothers.

Hi mister . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. , Could you answer a question, I'm really delving into the lore of FR, do the Harpers, currently in the fifth edition, still follow the codes and questions of the Haper code, from the second edition? Are they decentralized, disorganized and free?
They are still decentralized, though the western branch has more of a hierarchy (and uses Twilight Hall in Berdusk as their headquarters, as always) than the eastern "Senior Harpers." And they still follow the Code.

Forgotten Realms fans: Not a Decepticon wants to talk about Ed Greenwood's "What has befallen Elminster's home of 650 years?" video: https://thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?t=33277
What do you think about Elminster's tower, what Elminster is doing in Waterdeep and Storm Silverhand nursing Mordenkainen?
Sounded like Storm was doing more than just nursing
Tis never unwise to get on the good side of a wizard of peerless power.
And Storm's good side has nursed many a mage and Harper back from death or insanity.
She's my walking tribute to nurses and caregivers everywhere.

Hey, . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. , according to Cormanthor: Empire of Elves, Elves take some kind of education in mother-belly. Question is how that works for half-elves? Like if had an Elf mother and human father or half-Elf mother? How that affects the child?
Elf and half-elf mothers do this alike, regardless of who their child's father is. What differs with every individual mother and unborn babe is how well the teaching goes, and the child-to-be learns; it varies a lot (partly by the life experience of the mother).

Feb 05 09:29 (Realmslore)
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. got another query for you. When discussing those with "The Gift" for arcane magic, what happens when someone without The Gift tries to cast a spell? Does it not work because the weave doesn't listen to them, or because they are unconsciously doing it wrong, or what?
It doesn't work because they don't have the mental knack of visualizing the effect (& precise target/location/extent, if applicable) AND symbols formed in their mind by the somatic component AND connection to the Weave. You must do all three simultaneously to cast. (Arcane magic, that is.) Someone who lacks the Gift can't deliberately access the Weave, so even if they PRECISELY mimic an arcane spellcaster, and do everything exactly right, nothing will happen. It's like waving an electric table lamp around and expecting it to light up when it isn't plugged in. And when you work arcane spells and have the Gift, you are the light bulb. If you lack the Gift, the lamp has no bulb, just an empty socket where the bulb should plug in.
Some sages train their powers of concentration, and interview spellcasters  about the three-dimensional imagined images (usually lines of floating blue-white fire) that moving the caster's hands through the somatic component of the spell forms in the caster's mind, and so can write accurately about spellcasting but if they lack the Gift, magic  will never happen for them unless Mystra, Azuth, or another deity or servitor of a deity observes them, takes pity on them or wants to work through them, and "just makes it happen
In the Realms, this rare event most often happens when someone devoted to a place tries  to desperately defend it (example: an old caretaker, not clergy, of a temple who tries to keep it from being burned down or looted by raiders), and tries to copy what they've seen priests do, as they frantically call on the god--and the god sees and hears, and sends magic through them that they will likely never be able to work again.
So can someone without the gift still become a Cleric or Warlock and be granted regular access to magic by that more powerful being, or would you still need the Gift in the first place to do so with any reliability?
Clerics don't need the Gift, only wielders of arcane magic do.
Warlocks don't need the Gift IF their patron treats them like a conduit. If they lack the Gift, they are at the moment-to-moment whim of their patron, who can make a spell just "not work" in an instant if displeased.

Pendantry is fine; the specifics matter for my campaign! Thank you in advance
Jergal remains a god. All gods are divine beings, but not all divine beings are gods. For instance, many deities have servitors (e.g. the Chosen of Mystra). Some are effectively immortal, unless destroyed; they are divine but not gods. "God" is just a mortal label.

Oh, yes. Like humans, they vary widely in personality. Some are loyal and affectionate, many are as self-minded as the Luggage (Discworld), and a lot are "in between
Thank you so much for answering my question! It brightens my day immensely to gain wisdom from the master himself
My pleasure! (Some are companions or pets, others decidedly not. There's even a spelljammer sailing Realmspace crewed entirely by "treasure chests," meaning mimics that ate the goblin crew, and now go hunting the gullible to get fresh meals.)

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I was wondering if you could settle some speculation for me from fans of the D&D Cartoon from the 80s? There are some saying the show took place in Forgotten Realms back in 1983-1985. But most know it was called “The Realm” created just for the show.
The D&D Cartoon was deliberately set in its own "world." Not the Forgotten Realms.
The name "the Realm" was likely borrowed from FR, which was well established in the pages of The Dragon (DRAGON Magazine); Realms articles started appearing therein in 1979.

Jun 03 01:44 (Realmslore)
a question for science: does anyone know how tieflings get married? or how people in D&D get married in general? do they give vows in front of their deity? are there any interesting rituals?
I can't speak for D&D in general. In the Realms, ceremonies vary over time, place, budget, clan, and species, but primarily by the clergy the couples want to wed them (i.e. predominant faith, out of all the gods that everyone believes in). Over the years, I've  detailed over a dozen wedding rituals. Tieflings in the Realms don't have "tiefling weddings" based on race, no. As in our real world, ceremonies can vary if you're noble, if you're wealthy, and if the clergy approve of you or not (i.e. how much control you  can get over the ritual and surrounding celebrations). Some priests want a large donation, some (clergy of the Joybringer, for example) are happier with a huge feast with good musicians, dancing, and revelry the same things that would offend other clergy. thank you so much for giving an answer!
My pleasure!
For most weddings, in the Realms these days, the couple crafts their own ceremony with the clergy (or paladin) they want to wed them.
For tieflings, I'd expect they'd entwine tails during their vows, if said tails are long enough.

Building a setting primer for a particular sword coast ting, largely as a fun worldbuilding exercise, n finding myself wishing there was a word for the troglodyte language or culture - idk if . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. has one anywhere
Troglodytes in the Realms use scent, gesture, and spoken language to communicate, but beyond lone marker glyphs, don’t write. The language they use is Draconic (with a simplified vocabulary), but troglodytes just call it “Glav” (which is “speech” in Draconic).
They call themselves Vechrand, a name derived from the Draconic versvech = strong and arand = core, heart of, and when speaking of something they own or have made or that is of their culture, will say “uvech” which means ours, us, of us would this mean that "Uvech Glav" or some variation would be a suitable way for one of the Vechrand to refer to their particular dialect / way of communicating?
Sure. Just "Glav" with one another (fellow troglodytes) in daily usage. "Uvech Glav" only when they're trying to distinguish between Vechrand converse and, say, a dragon and a human wizard speaking Draconic.

Bane first appeared in the Mirt the Moneylender short story "Even Her Fangs Had Talons" published in SWORDS OF THE NORTH Issue #2, September 1968. (Yes, before D&D was created.)

Ed Greenwood, on Forgotten Realms weddings!
If my Adventurers League Conjurer ever gets married, I'd want to attend since she follows Azuth; my Illusionist's might be confusing, her veering towards Leira and all 😹😿 "Are you two married, now, or not ? What's goin g on?"
Those who venerate Leira strongly discover: for major life choices (getting married, sacrificing one’s own life, taking a life) Leira wants NO deception, but The Truth of Revelation (“Truth Revealed”): showing the world plainly and clearly where one stands.

My greatest Man! I love Malar and FR bald Jesus aka Ilmater! Can you name some awesome facts about them as well?
Here’s a quick list of interesting Malar lore:
Worgs worship Malar, as “The Great One,” who rewards them when they pass by accepting them into the Great Hunt that never ends; bloodlust time, when they can savage former masters along with all other juicy prey.
The more “elemental/natural” the essential nature of a deity (Malar, also Auril, Chauntea, Eldath, Silvanus, and Talos), the more they feel the need to connect directly with the land.
Followers of Malar openly seek to destroy the church and works of Helm.
Malar personally hunts and seeks to slay and devour other deities (of a power level he thinks he can overcome), quasi-deities, and the divine servitors of other deities. He lurks and watches such targets for weaknesses, and so, knows more about their doings  and habits than many. His goal? To replace deities, receiving their worship (and granting spells to their clergies in their name, so not even their churches will realize what he’s done). It remains to be seen how far Ao will let him go, down this murderous path.

My greatest Man! I love Malar and FR bald Jesus aka Ilmater! Can you name some awesome facts about them as well?
And now, lore of Ilmater:
Most Ilmatari clergy who advance in the regard of the deity accept pain and suffering to aid others rather than self-inflicting. Self-inflicting is usually done only as self-punishment for transgressions from tasks set for Ilmatari by  superiors. In the original Realms campaign, the only Ilmatari cleric who sought out harm for himself was driven to do so by dream-visions he believed were sent by the god as guidance. Most Ilmatari think self-harm is “cheap show” rather than real devotion.
The Book of Torment isn’t the same as the Tome of Torment (which is a hair shirt I detailed in the Prayers From The Faithful 2e Realms sourcebook). The Book of Torment began as an in-house (not for public eyes) Church of Ilmater account of the times that 
Ilmater directly responded to prayers, entreaties, and queries from his clergy. Copies were made and distributed to every temple. And then, over time, spells and rituals and church rulings were added, new editions of the book produced, and old copies  retired” to altar flames. Each new edition has multiple copies written out by hand, so they can be distributed to every temple (not all the shrines, just full temples).
Priests of Ilmater can and do fight on behalf of others, but when their own faith is  attacked, are essentially pacifists; they’re “turn the other cheek, take the punishment” sorts (with a few paladin exceptions).
Ilmater will occasionally send altar-visions or dream-visions to his faithful (clergy and lay worshippers, adventurers in particular) that to achieve a specific result, battle, aggression, and even deception on their part are approved by him—but only for this particular purpose. As a result, no others can “depend” on Ilmatari “always” surrendering or standing aside or submitting.

She looks like she means business. Who is she?
That’s Clarorna Amaerityl, wizardess of Athkatla, often hired by House Selemchant when they ran into mercantile resistance that might involve violence. Known to be researching longevity alternatives to lichdom, as her years weigh on her (she’s over ninety though she looks about 48 winters old) and her body starts to ache, pain, and become increasingly frail. Her everpresent pain has noticeably shortened her temper.
A brilliant woman who is kind to simple and common folk, but expects the wealthy and powerful to  behave responsibly. Has been known to speak very bluntly to the Council of Five when she thinks their policies are cruel or shortsighted.
A formidable foe in a fight, thanks to her chain contingency spells, that unleash four to six “hanging” spells in  succession, once triggered, that usually whisk her away from a fray to healing elsewhere, and unleash various “parting shot” magics.
A friend to Laeral, but cool to Alustriel. Regards Elminster as a useful “loose cannon,” and has been known to jest with him.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Was the canal near Innarlith connecting the Nagaflow to the Lake of Steam finished & is it still extant? It is only on maps in the Watercourse trilogy(?). IF this exists, what prevents a city on it from becoming a MAJOR trade hub rivaling any Sword Coast port? Thx!
The canal was finished. However, it started to silt up due to the velocity with which the Nagaflow emptied through it almost immediately, and the canal quickly became impassible to deep-draft ships: only small boats, coracles, and rafts could pass through it  reliably. On several occasions, larger ships “ran aground” in it and became obstacles that had to be set afire (to burn to the waterline), and then the hulls dragged out with the assistance of water elementals and the like. Eventually barge travel began  along it, but was immediately plagued by fighting between mercenary forces hired by various Calishite straps, the Zhentarim, and various merchant costers who set up bases in Innarlith and in encampments and nearby keeps. Barges were sunk, burned, boarded and  taken, retaken, and then ships were hired to blockade the Lake of Steam end of the canal, then deliberately sunk to block the Lake of Steam end of the canal (as the silt brought from the Nagaflow piled up around these hulks). .all in the name of controlling  canal traffic to enrich this or that interest.
In the end, the canal never became a fast, profitable trade route for anyone, because the fighting was still going on when the canal was utterly destroyed in the Second Sundering (in 1482 DR), blocked by a  mountain range from Abeir that changed the course of the Nagaflow 107 years after the canal was completed. When the Sundering was done (Abeir and Toril had “passed through” each other and moved on—for now), the canal was little more than tortured ground, full of mountainous heaps of loose rock, and no water. With various Red Wizards sent to spy on, and prevent, any Zhentarim (or anyone else’s) attempts to dig a new canal.
So, entrenched interests successfully prevented this new competition for trade flows between  the Sword Coast and the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Oh wow! Did you ever envisioning a franchise like the video games springing up from it?
Did you have any hand with the lore with the first 2 games? (Which are my favorite video games ever made btw :^) )
When I created Baldur's Gate there were no personal computers (that the general public could buy). Not until not quite 20 years later. Video games were coin-operated arcade machines then.
Yes, I created many book titles found in the game (& all the background lore).

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hey Ed, starting your Novel Spellstorm because of an interest in Cormyr nobility for a character idea I had and just wondering, did you ever visualize what House Halaut coat of arms was sorta leaning on this house for a character and would love to stay in lore.
Sure! In modern heraldic cant, House Halaunt’s blazon is thus:
Arms: Pean on a Bend Sable fimbriated Or between two Eagles displayed Argent beaked legged and crowned Or three Estoiles Argent.
Crest: Rising from a Mural Crown Or a Sun irradiated proper.
Supporters: On the dexter a Pegasus Argent crined unguled and winged Or and on the sinister a Lion guardant winged at the shoulders Or the whole upon a Grassy Mound proper
In everyday speech, this is:
A face-on shield of slate gray with a gold-edged diagonal  gray stripe crossing it from upper left to bottom right, with three silver six-wavy-pointed stars spaced evenly along the stripe. Above and below the stripe are mirrored fields of gray with many small identical gold charges that all look like a point-up  equilateral triangle of gold balls with a straight-down three-pointed tail decending from the triangles, spaced in a pattern all over them, and centered in the lower left and the upper right fields are two silver eagles, wings raised and splayed out, gold  legs also splayed out, beaks to the left (so, heads side-on), and these eagles are wearing little gold three-squared-off-pointed crowns.
Floating just above the shield is a side-on golden crown that has four squared-off points (spikes); these points are the  crenelations of a castle wall (battlements), because the crown itself is made up of visible gold blocks (you can see the joints between them, so it looks like a brick wall humped in the center like a footbridge over a river that curves up and down in an arc).
Rising up out of the crown (so that its bottom rays are “behind” the crown’s inner two crenelations/points) is a sun: a gold disc with five straight rays or points (up, left, right, and two diagonal lower ones), with a second layer of wavy golden rays behind  it, so that there’s a wavy ray between each straight point.
A silver pegasus is standing on its hind legs, on a ground made up of little green (grassy) humps, holding up the viewer’s left side of the shield. It is looking straight at the other supporter  (so, head side-on to the viewer) and has uplifted golden wings (big feathers) and golden hooves. On the right side of the shield, also standing on its hind legs on the grassy ground, is a red-clawed golden lion, also with uplifted big-feathered golden  wings, but it’s snarling right at the viewer (head turned to face the viewer).
Underneath is a gold-hued scroll (its back surface is shown at either end, where it’s curved in a frozen “flapping-tail” position, and is revealed to be scarlet) bearing a motto  (not officially part of the blazon, but still regulated by the High Heralds), which reads in the Common Tongue: “Stand True"
And there you have it: the blazon/arms of House Halaunt.

Okay, here we go 
Note: In the Realms today, many dwarves use the Common Tongue studded with words in Dwarvish. Terms such as aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, and nephew are in Dwarvish rendered thus: “aunt” is sister-of-father or father-sister (“kralvade-karra”) and a cousin is son-of-aunt or aunt-son (“kralvade-karra-aurvel”) or daughter-of-uncle or uncle-daughter (“kralvade-kral-auva”). aurvel: son auva: daughter ilith: deal, agreement, trust of one’s word or honor karra: my heir or I am the heir of (female) karravade: mother of (speaker or another) kral: my heir or I am the heir of (male) kralvade: father of (speaker or another) krauth: immediate kin, daily living-with family (bloodkin as opposed to friends and companions) larrul: to weep luthkarra: sister by birth/blood luthlarkarra: sister by marriage luthkral: brother by birth/blood luthlarkral: brother by marriage mur: to disagree murmel: to argue, debate murmelings: arguments, criticism, words of dissention runedar: home, familiar place, haven sakrauth: trusted kin samman: trusted friend, shield-brother (battle companion) taerin: love (true love, ‘deep’ love) tah: converse, discourse, discussion tahul: to speak, to discuss thalorn: kindness, caring, good deed tulvade: an elder or senior (dwarf of a community, clan or family) uldoum: favored dwarven settlement, meaning favored by the speaker, which is a formal way of saying “I am of that settlement” vakrauth: distant bloodkin (lineage, not just of the same clan)

Hello Ed! My Waterdeep: Dragonheist character is getting married and I'm throwing a one-shot in the near future about it. I started to wonder if there are any beliefs about months and dates for weddings - such as some days being more unlucky to have a wedding etc?
Certainly! Never get married on Deadwinter Day (Midwinter) unless you want the marriage bed to soon be cold and loveless.
Get married on Greengrass if you want lots of children for the union (twins, triplets, etc.)
Get married on Shieldmeet only if all parties to the wedding are political and enjoy negotiations and agreements. .or the marriage won’t last.
Get married on Highharvestide if you want the union to enrich all involved (worldly prosperity).
Never get married on the Feast of the Moon unless you want the marriage to be haunted by dead ancestors whispering advice or disapproval.
And then there are specific family beliefs and traditions rooted in past family history (many noble families have these).

My partner plays a rich half-elven bard of Oghma from Neverwinter. They studied at Candlekeep for a long time and aquired tomes and artifacts for them as an adventurer. Any particular turns of phrase I could share with them?
Oh, yes. The Avowed of Candlekeep have quite a few favorite phrases.
The tomes know, and tell. They always tell
And:
Lore is neither a hoard-pile nor a finished thing. Lore is lifelong pathways. Our lives run out before we reach the ends
And:
Knowledge is more than a candle in the dark. Knowledge is a bridge between us all
And:
Lore contradicts not just due to lies, but because we see the same things differently. Lore tells about ourselves, not just about what it describes
And:
You can’t eat lore, but lore can tell you where the edibles are
And:
Lore is the cloak that never fails when storms claw (They have lots more homilies, but these should be a good start.)

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Apology’s to bother you but I was curious, I’m doing some fan writing for my dnd character’s backstory & I have her main source of knowledge coming from the lady’s college in Silverymoon. By chance is there a name for the central building there? Thank you in advance!
The many-turreted main building of the Lady's College (best depicted on the 3e map of Silverymoon) is known formally as The Lady’s House, and bears the far more widely used nickname “Ladyspires” (or, “The Ladyspires”).

Who is Kazra Louantrar?
Kazra Louantrar was a Chosen of Eilistraee during the Second Sundering. Remembered for leading drow of the Dancer in battle against Lolth priestesses, and vanquishing them. She died heroically in the battle, so worshippers of Eilistraee sometimes swear by her name.

this might be the wrong place to ask, but working on a story for characters. the elf found out his love (that were unbonded because different paths) perished in the fall of myth drannor. is there a ceremony or ritual he would perform, like a memorial, since he is not able to bury
Yes, there is a song of remembrance he would compose, listing the dead love’s achievements in life and/or the qualities that made the lamenting singer love this individual, that the elf would sing at sunset, in a place beloved by the departed or failing that on a height that preferably overlooks lands the dead individual knew.
Moreover, if the lamenter knows of an unfinished task or obligation, large or small, the dead elf didn’t manage to fulfil, it’s an act of love to fulfil it. thank you so much! really appreciate you taking hte time to answer a question.
My pleasure!

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hi Ed! As someone who has been running personalized variations of your module "The Haunted Halls of Eveningstar" to introduce new players to AD&D for many years, I've always wondered about Miior—Is there more to her character/story? (art by the amazing . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. here's the short version 
Miior was the consort of the bandit lord Rivior. When Queen Enchara of Esparin lured Rivior out of the Haunted Halls, and ambushed and slew him, she sent a small band of warriors, along with her ally, the adventurer-wizard 
Thorond Halavur, into the Halls to secure it (make certain Rivior didn’t have a secondary force still inside). They slew the few bandits still there, except for Miior, who barricaded herself in Rivior’s bedchamber and defended herself with spells.
Thorond wore her down (ran her out of spells) with spells of his own, and then the Esparrans charged in. Thorond used a vial of venom (that he forced her to drink) to make Miior helpless, searched her and took away her wands and spellbooks, then chained her in  the closet and cast temporal stasis on her. He intended to return later to question her thoroughly, but was killed in fighting several days later.
After chaining Miior, the Esparrans then plundered the bedchamber and the rest of the Halls (in a hasty, slapdash manner; they were mainly searching for bandits in hiding), and Thorond cast a powerful ward to “wall off” Miior and that area of the Halls from opportunistic explorers and monsters (a ward that was broken by later adventurers only shortly before  before THE HAUNTED HALLS OF EVENINGSTAR unfolds, which is why no one finds Miior before the PCs in that adventure).
Miior is smart, quick-witted, and observant, a seasoned adventurer. If rescued by PCs, she will likely try to befriend them, and even become  the lover of one or more, for two reasons: she always wants to be linked to a stronger male as a protector, provider, and dupe (someone she can frame and/or steal from), and she is looking for a real lifemate (in other words, she will feign “falling for” a PC  adventurer, strong and wealthy human male preferred, but either gender and any race if someone else seems more useful, and she’s a consumate actress, but she can very easily genuinely fall in love with either her “chosen dupe” or someone else, and with that  love will come loyalty, so she may later stand beside and support her dupe, returning swindled loot, and become his/her staunch partner.
Miior is essentially a good person, but has the wiles of an adventurer who’s been burned a time or two. She was born in 
Chessenta, into a servant family, but her powerful Gift manifested young, and she got trained as a “house wizard” by a minor Chessentan noble who hoped to use her as a weapon against other nobles. Unfortunately, he lost his life in battles with rivals, who  hunted his forces to extinction—save for Miior, who was captured for her beauty rather than slain, by soldiers who didn’t know she was a mage, used magic to escape, and fled, adventuring her way across Turmish and through Westgate and into Cormyr. Seeking  a life for herself that didn’t involve being someone’s "house wizard" and controlled, she ended up in the Stonelands, among bandits. .and eventually into the arms of the strongest, most successful bandit, Rivior. [And that's the short version. :} ]
Nice pic of Miior, by the way. Captures her face and hair very well from my mental vision of her.

My pleasure! It's up to you, of course, how much Miior knows about magic items hidden elsewhere in the Halls, that she might want to acquire before leaving, perhaps with PC adventurers not knowing or being duped into helping her.

Give the deity’s rival deities more power, and disrupt the deity’s hold over their portfolio in the same stroke, with visions and magical energy sent through major temple altars of those rivals.

Jul 10 03:57 (Realmslore)
I figured I should go straight to the source on this one . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Drow and tattoos? Inquiring minds are having a discussion that’s pretty split down the middle.
Well, here's the thing: as drow of old used tattoos to mark slaves, many drow detest tattoos. However, early Lolth priestesses used progressively-augmented tattoos (down their right inner thighs, eventually to the ankle) to mark ascending clerical rank.
Drow who don't venerate Lolth usually dislike tattoos (on drow) for that reason, in addition to the slavery. However, among Vhaeraun worshippers in the early 1300s DR, a fashion arose to tattoo around one's right eye (bare ring around the eye, then an elaborate  design radiating out over brow and cheek on one side of the face only). This was regarded as beauty enhancing, not a mark of devotion to the god.
In addition, certain drow sorceresses hit upon the notion of storing self-renewing spells in right forearm tattoos.
So as you can see, drow are split, just as the gamer debate is. Most drow detest tattooing, seeing it as marring drow natural beauty. However, drow who see themselves as ugly usually reason that they have nothing to lose by getting tattoos.
And a drow who bears  slave tattoos and gets the opportunity to do something about them will almost always expand the tattoos into a larger, more beautiful design that seeks to obscure the original slaving marks.
I never knew about the inner thigh tattoo this is so freaking cool!
A "supressed in editing due to Code of Conduct" lore detail. (TSR didn't want lawsuits from parents of kids who got D&D game-related tattoos.)
Later, D&D art briefly went tattoo-positive.
I recall a lady who did the "henna temporary tattoo" thing for her GenCon drow cosplay.

Hi . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. So I am not fully done reading the super fun Last Mythal series, but my question is, what were Elminster and the other Chosen (save Storm who was there and Khelben 😢) doing during the cataclysmic events of this series? Halaster craziness?
The Chosen of Mystra were VERY busy at this time (1375 DR) preparing new Weave anchors, wards, and mantles to minimize the destruction that might be caused by what Halaster was working to do (that he failed in, causing the earthquake that rocked Waterdeep), and  what the Twisted Rune, the Arcane Brotherhood, and certain beholder cabals and illithid schemers might try, with Thayan and Zhent armies on the march. The Chosen do a lot of gluing and holding the world together, while others recklessly try to break it.

Sir . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. , I'm playing a character who is a descendant of a Damphyr descended from Kheben Arunsun and Nyressa Fless, is there any possibility of him having a relationship with a vampire?
Certainly. Any female vampire might want a dhampir as a follower, and if that dhampir’s character was such that love arose between them, the relationship could become a love match rather than just “master and dominated ally
Moreover, any descendant of Nyressa Flass would want allies, for fear of Szass Tam sending endless Red Wizards on eradication bent. Be aware that your character would become a Red Wizard target, too.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Oh Great Sage, would you be able to tell me what the name of Hullack Forest was (near Cormyr) when the Elves lived there before the coming of the humans? And what that name might translate into in common?
Certainly!
Of old, the Hullack wasn’t an isolated forest, it was part of the southwestern end of the great forest of Cormanthor. The elves referred to that part of the great wood as “Dragon End” due to the presence of dragons in the Stormhorns and the 
Thunder Peaks, who hunted in that area.
In Elvish, it was (and still is) “Orm” [dragon] + “Aar” [woodland] + “sharan” [end, edge, boundary, farthest reach]: Ormaarsharan.
Save for a few elves who instead call it “Waeluir” (or Luirarra Lost, meaning the place a  long-ago beloved elf sorceress, Luirarra, died).

Would they have to come from another plane or would they be from Toril?
They would likely come through a gate/portal from another world (Prime Material Plane). There are a handful of worshippers of Prometheus in the Realms, but "Zeus" is mainly a name known to sages, the Avowed, and adventurers who like to colourfully curse (without  knowing whom they're invoking).

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hey Ed, question for you!
I know of some documented cases where Helmites & Selûnites have worked together, such as the Fellowship of the Purple Staff. Could and would Helmites and Selûnites work together more regularly?
Context in the following tweets on why I ask!
Yes, they could and would. Among the mortal priesthoods spread across the Realms, there are constant alliances, pacts, and even armed expeditions wherein faiths whose current needs, not just dogmas, run together/share common ground, work together against common foes/obstacles.
So, yes, Helm and Selûne clergy can and do work together often. Seldom officially "before all the Watching Gods," but always with the approval of high-ranking priests. Just as the clerical forces of evil deities work together.
Always neglected in official lore  due to the Code of Conduct and concerns about real-world believer backlash, but it's been in the Realms since before D&D. Interfaith feuds, negotiations, misunderstandings, out-and-out wars, and backdoor skirmishes are an essential part of the Realms.
But in your campaign only if you want them to be, of course.

I have two questions for you  ] supposing you had been invited to work on a rebooted forgotten realms that and had started again from the year of the Prince [aka the grey box] would you change anything as far as the continuity developed? and now to your first query.
TSR controlled the storylines of the published Realms, but if we were starting over and I was given that control, I would avoid all RSEs (Realms-Shaking Events) like the Time of Troubles, Spellplague, and Second Sundering.
Big changes would only happen with lots of foreshadowing/buildup in many published releases, and only after we'd covered the entire surface world, and a good bit of the Underdark and celestial (Tears of Selune, etc.) Realms, too, at least once over.
Build up  before you tear down.
There were also things I never got the chance to do (completed detailed city? Ath Cliath, which I'm doing with Andrew Valkauskas and Mike Schley for #FateOfTheNorns right now, because I never got the wordcount to do it with Waterdeep or Suzail, or..) and many DM's campaign toolbox releases (the Haunted Halls was supposed to be 96 pages and completely detail Eveningstar, not 32 pages and just do highlights of the Halls, likewise Undermountain).
Moreover, Books and Games would work together closely, so what authors craft for novels are fully described in game terms with the authors approval and involvement, so the Realms can really grow in all directions with each writer getting proper treatment.
And so on. This is a big topic
Do you feel like the Realms has diverged substantially over time from your original imagination of it, due to these sorts of events?
Not really. Grown, yes, diverged not so much. I've stayed involved, feeding lore to every creative I can, so I have been able to do a little steering from behind the scenes, and except for the RSEs, we're still exploring my original, seeing more and deeper

Zhents themselves say "ZENT-tar-rim," but many call them "Zen-TARR-im" and they don't correct it, and folk of the eastern lands (Raurin, Semphar, et al) often say "Zenn-tah-reem" because of their accents, and again, no corrections forthcome.

Something I've always wondered: did you always intend for Ao to be a "hands off the steering wheel" kind of figure or has he ever taken a more direct role in the Forgotten Realms?
TSR added Ao to the Realms, so I had no "always" intentions for him at all.
Once he was there, I saw him as a Watcher hands-off figure who drew a line in the sand for deities, and when they stepped over it, humbled them and calmly went back to watching. Over and over if needed.

There, over lasagna and a rousing game of pinocle, Dalamar would see Raistlin in his little fishbowl, and finally crack a smile.
No, Grumpy Trout is off the menu.
And El knows how to make Dalamar crack a smile, but some things ARE private.
For the sake of the children, you understand.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. In Travel Talk: Barovia from Dragon+ #6, you mention "toasted delfarnbread with spiced snail-butter" (Volo speaking about his dealings with Qelver)
What is delfarnbread, and where does it hail from in the Realms?
Delfarnbread is made with malt barley, so it's akin to what's sold in modern-day North America as "malt bread," only saltier, drier, and more tan-brown.
Named for the baker who popularized it, it's made today all over the Dales, Sembia, Cormyr and new sites westwards.

Drow junk/snack food - like, what sorts of unhealthy but yummy fried things would they sell on the streets?
Mushrooms?
Spiders? (Like in Cambodia)
Deep fried spiders (usually frying oil: pack lizard fat) dusted with certain mushrooms and cave lichens for seasoning. The legs curl up in the oil. Crunchy, rust brown, yummy.
Certain cave glow-worms, raw, are considered a delicacy by drow. Squirmy. Glistening white, segmented, fat, and short. Tastes like a fishy banana.

Yes, they do!
I wanted TSR to publish 3 as free giveaways for trade shows:
Waterdeep (a street scene, looking up to Piergeiron's Palace), the Underdark (looking up to Menzo's inhabited stalactites), and Shadowdale (looking up to Elminster's Tower).
But nothing came of my plan.

Hi . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. what role does divination magic play in royal courts and high councils of Faerun?
It varies greatly. There are lots of royalty and nobility who think those who cast divination magics use them to sway those in power to their own plans, policies, and views. Trust comes hard.

In the Realms, these exist as ads (views of inns and taverns that include maps in the "frame pages"), and as tales for children (mainly "monsters lurk everywhere" tales).

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hello Ed! How differently (on average) would a 20 year old human and a 20 year-old elf behave?
This varies widely with the individuals involved, but in general (in the Realms), the elf will seem far more "mature" because they've mastered reading social cues so much more (they know how to act/what to say to elicit particular reactions from others around them).

Question . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. , does the weave function any more or less in space? Would something like a black hole affect it?
The Weave reaches throughout Realmspace, but in the “void” areas of other crystal spheres is thin/attenuated. A black hole would tug the Weave towards it, so if you are approaching a black hole, magic grows stronger so you can access it more easily to work  spells (so for example, if you want to escape the hole and want a teleport or similar translocation spell to get away, you can draw on spells of level slots above what you can currently reach, or have left, to try).
So, I am currently at the beginning of a game in which the party is sent by an archmage to "repair" tears in the weave. How would you yourself go about this, the tears in the weave and the repair thing? Do you have any ideas for interesting side effects of a tear?
Careful! Doing so drains magic items, artifacts, and even the life force of the caster.
Elminster's attempt to repair a planar rift landed him in the Nine Hells (see my novel Elminster In Hell).
Proper answer in two days or so, when back from a convention (Hastings D&D Festival!)

Wait the idea of magic pooling in areas and allowing access to spell slots above what you can cast is really dope. I've always allowed multiple spellcasters to pool their abilities to cast higher level spells, but the idea of just a bundle of the weave doing it too is awesome.
It happens also in "the heart of the forest" dells and other localized nodes, like druid's groves and certain caverns (luckily for the rest of us, usually too small for dragons to enter). Warning: some magic-hurling creatures may lair in such places.

Something I've always been confused on is the difference between Weave magic and Wild Magic? What is the difference? Is wild Magic just the Weave but unfiltered because of the caster?
Magic is "quickly drawing on natural forces to produce specific effects
The Weave is the unseen webwork of natural forces throughout the world, but only when accessed through arcane magic rather than other means (other types of magic).
Wild magic" is what we call those forces producing unforeseen/uncontrolled effects.
This can occur spontaneously, most often happens when newly-cast/unlashed magic hits older magic active in the same area, and some arcane spellcasters can cast/spur "wild magic

This might seem like a silly question but how much of the cosmos came from your imagination too?
How much of the Outer Planes and Realmspace did you have a hand in creating and tangentially, out of the FR Gods, who is your favourite/who would you personally choose to worship?
The cosmologies were created over time, in-house (by staff designers at TSR and later WotC).
Gary Gygax outlined the planes in issue 8 of The Dragon, then in issue 67 detailed the Astral Plane. I detailed the Nine Hells in three issues of Dragon, and have had an  ongoing hand down the years in detailing planes crafted by others. Stephen Inniss and I co-detailed Limbo, in approximately 360 never-published pages. (That's where Stephen's lillend monster comes from.)
And if I lived in the Realms, I'd worship ALL of the deities; no sane inhabitant of Toril is a monotheist.
I do have faves: Mystra, Azuth, Eldath, Lurue, Chauntea, Sharess, Eilistraee, but almost all of them are "my children," so I don't want to choose just one.

Hi, I have a question. Is posible for me, use the planes of D&D in a novel I am writing?
Strictly speaking, no, they are part of the copyrighted and trademarked IP owned by Hasbro (via TSR and Wizards of the Coast).
HOWEVER, many of the planes of D&D are drawn from pre-copyright-days mythology, and you CAN use those (the rivers Styx and Lethe, some planes). Research!
You can include features of those planes that come from old real-world mythology, but avoid reproducing specific details that TSR, Wizards, and other licensed modern writers have added. In other words, make the planes your own!

What about henotheism as opposed to monotheism? Where you acknowledge the existence of multiple gods but exclusively devote yourself to one? The ancient near East ran on this theology, as did much of Ancient Greece and Rome, and certain sects of Hinduism still practice it now.
Almost all clergy and most paladins in the Realms are henotheists, but almost everybody else believes in, and worships, all the gods--at least of their race's pantheon, or their region's pantheon. (The Realms is not a real world analog.)

Shadowweave?
Okay, seriously: the Shadow Weave can be metaphorically seen as the spaces between the strands of the Weave. It's a "shadow" or "echo" system that feeds upon/relies upon the Weave for its structure and reach, but has different gatekeepers.
Shar established it to  she and her clergy controlled, and not Mystra, Azuth, their clergy, and arcane spellcasters following "the rules" of established arcane spells.
However, just by collapsing the Weave in a locale, Mystra can "crash" that section of Shadow Weave, too; the Shadow 
Weave needs the Weave to exist and function (but not vice versa).

Forgot where I read it, but couldn't Halaster uae both the true Weave and the Shadow Weave? How is that possible? Different personalities using different Weaves?
All "Weavemasters" (i.e. all of the Chosen of Mystra and Azuth) can use both, as they are absolute masters of the Weave, and can see how the Shadow Weave relies on it, and so work through the Shadow Weave.
Analogy: if you built a skyscraper and are still up in the  boom crane, and someone else builds a cagework scaffolding up to your boom crane, you can see down into it, are already familiar with cagework, and so can readily use your crane to access their scaffolding.

But guessing Mystra or Azuth wouldn't be terribly happy about Elminster dipping his toes into the Shadow Weave? Or have they kind of accepted that the Shadow Weave is here to stay and a part of the Weave, for better or worse?
From my reading of Ed’s answer, I think you’d find Weave masters can work through the Shadow Weave to access the Weave (they use the anchor points that Shar created to allow the Shadow Weave to “drain” the Weave), thus they never truly use the Shadow Weave
Exactly!

Yeah, that's often had me wondering how successful of a gambit the shadow weave actually is for Shar. Did it accidentally grant Mystra MORE power? Does it give Shar a back door to use against Mystra? Or did it accidently make Shar somewhat depandant on Mystra?
In order: no, no (though Shar thought it would), and yes.
Shar has started to realize that, but it's taken her surprisingly long.
That's what delusions of supreme godhood will do to you.

Remember each ship sailing the Flow generates its own gravity well?
So you put something enchanted with the Weave aboard (like, ahem, a spelljamming helm, or a glowing globe), and it generates a sphere of the Weave about a hundred yards across (artifacts = larger).

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. is their a sport similar to bowling in the Realms?
Several.
On pond and lake ice in winter, orcs play Nuuglah (“New-GLAH!”) which translated is “Bowling Gnomes” (nuug = gnome, gnomes, glah = to smite and knock over), the gnomes being marked by frozen dungpiles, rocks, or ice boulders.
On meadows and lawns, humans and elves and half-elves play Castledown, which is like lawn bowling (the “bowl” or ball that’s bowled to play is rolled, not thrown, but is round like a bocce ball, though imperfections are allowed, an inheritance of when broken-off  statue heads, or skulls, were used; the jack or white target ball is “the castle”).
In the Moonsea North, the Vast, and the Dales, “Nine Knights” is played on pond and lake ice in winter: lines of nine identical "knights" or markers are set up in a straight  realmslore line across the field of hurling, and discs of ice are tossed/bounced/slid across the ice to try to knock them over. Each player throws three “sieges,” scoring a point per knight fallen (knocked out of position doesn’t count if the knight ends up upright) highest score wins, and ties mean extra sieges in elimination rounds.

Dragons could polymorph/shapeshift into other beings easily even back in 1e though, so I don't think the existence of humanoid/dragon offspring really proves all that much in terms of how well a human can take a dragon at its full size (even though I do support Melissa on this).
SOME D&D dragon types could shift shape, but most could not in 1e (and dragons didn't have free range of spell lists). Gary had half-dragons of dragon types that couldn't in the game, so their existence did prove that human/dragon matings could be successful.
When you wrote for The Dragon back then, and wanted to use dragons in an article, you were sent (by mail; no Internet back then) a little list of "dragon do's and don'ts" as Gary wanted the dragon types kept different from each other, and dragon magic "different

They didn't all have it written into their entries, and it seemed to mostly be mentioned for metallic dragons (Bornze turning into animals to keep observe humans, Gold and Silver often would assume a humanoid form). But these are mostly mentioned in relation to what form a player would have encountered them in, which then makes sense for the mostly benevolent metallics to take on a non-threatening form, while the chromatic ones would be more prone to flaunting their imposing visage on first meeting. Would you happen to know by any chance if Gary has at any point mentioned if that was the reason why some of the statblocks did not contain any mentions of polymorphing or other form of innate shapeshifting? Cause it does make me wonder if the difference was in actual capabilities, or intended to be more of a matter of behaviour.
The difference was actual abilities.
One driving aim of chromatic dragons was to gain magic (by seizing magic items, PC wizards and spellbooks) that they didn't have.
Dragons trust no other dragons, and need to experiment or be tutored to turn V/S/M into verbal-only spells.
On at least two occasions playing at early GenCons with Gary as DM, we the PC party had to try to rescue spellcasters red or blue dragons had seized and taken back to their lairs, for this very purpose.
Chromatics could only change shape by means of spells they acquire.
And I encountered half-dragons with red, blue, white, and copper heritage at Gary's gaming table (and in 1st Edition, only the copper parent could have "naturally" taken human form for mating purposes).

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Can you give me some insight as to why the Ninth layer of Hell is called Nessus? All I can find is the centaur by that name, before your article in Dragon #76.;)
Sure.
Many ancient real-world texts (Jewish, Islamic, Zoroastrian, the various Christian churches etc.) mention various ‘bad places souls go to after death, as punishment for evil deeds’ by various names (the Nine Hells concept comes from these texts, too).
I borrowed one Greek name, néomai (“to return”), from which we get the names Nestor and Nessus, thanks to an idea Roger Zelazny had talked about with me (he used it in his novel SHADOWJACK) about how Darksiders, when they die, are reborn in the bad place, naked  and with a stone in their hands which is their soul. I loved that, and made it “my” lowest layer of Hell, for the Realms. “Nestor” sounded like the name of a being, “Nessus” sounded like a place. So, Nessus it became.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I have a question, assuming you had a hand in their creation. What were some of the inspirations for the culture of the Dragonborn, how their clans are structured, and their hierarchy? I love how their natural "good" nature is contrasted with a warrior culture.
I had half-dragons in my original Realms (pre-D&D), but "dragonborn" in either of the versions still official in the game aren't my creations. I believe TSR staffers and later WotC staffers crafted them.

My friends and I have been debating and we need to know: If a dragonborn (or half-dragon) is born from a dragon mother, I'm assuming they come from an egg. But what if they come from a human mother? Do they still come out in an egg? Or do they come out like human babies do?
They come out like human babies do, except that the newborn is wrapped in a caul (thin but tough translucent pearly-gray porous membrane; the baby CAN breathe through it, if no one tears it). So: flexible eggshell covering of sorts.

I will die on this hill:
Power Word Kill" is wrong.
Should be "Power Word Die", obviously.
Writing a #DnD text on power word spells.
Hey . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. the only thing I could find is that power words were invented (discovered?) by the Netherese. Is there anything more on origins?
Power word" spells came from dragons, whose magic was (1st Ed) verbal only. The Netherese, the Imaskari, and before them, elves, all "eavesdropped" them from dragons, then developed their own versions of what they'd witnessed cast, and so knew could be done.
Hmm so would that mean all the "Power Word" spells are in draconic? Or at least derived from draconic?
Derived from Draconic, yes.
Many are "slightly altered" Draconic words, the slight alteration being the syllables that are the Weave-calling-and-suffusing incantation. (To stop dragons giving other dragons directions from inadvertently hurling multiple spells.)
Do they also have a basis in origin with true name magic?
Yes, in that dragons seem to have discovered that truenames gave magical connections to their owners before anyone else, and developed verbal-only spells exploiting that before other species.
Maybe I’m just weird but I’d make Power Word Moist render all spell books and scrolls too damp for extended use
But I’m a weird DM
Can Power Word Lick be far behind? (Yes, folks, and now you know the sort of repartee TSR designers slung back and forth, all the time.)
So, the spell should be cast by saying "svent" (to kill, in Draconic)? Or "versellex: svent" (Power Word: To Kill)?
If literal is your style, "svent" PLUS the modifying words that add the incantation can be your uttered spell.
The modifiers must be there, to draw on the Weave/bind magical energy to the word --or every time you said the word "kill" you'd unleash deadly magic.

what’s the lore accurate DnD way to say “jesus fucking christ” adjusts my fedora*
Well you see it depends on the campaign setting in which you are playing m'lady
HM i’m technically operating from forgotten realms and bg3 since i’m new to DnD as a whole
Good good it's one of my fav settings and I'm also making my own game inspired that setting too. You're doing it right. I hope you enjoy the world and have a great time! (Dark Sun is my other fav DnD setting) ooo i’ll have to look into dark sun! yes i’m having a great time! i was a fantasy hater for so long it feels like i’m in a whole new world and i don’t know how i could’ve been so blind!
Oh well the Forgotten Realms is one of the richest fantasy settings ever created, up there with Middle Earth I think. You're going to love the journey of discovery the more you learn and read about that world.
Dark Sun is coooool its like Mad Max DnD and it goes HARD do you have any favorite books or podcasts or anything like that about forgotten realms? i know it’s a crazy expansive IP so i imagine there’s a Lot going on but fuck yeah i love mad max. one day i’ll have a group of people to play DnD with so i can actually explore these worlds!
Oh I'm not really a podcast person BUT you should absolutely 100000% follow . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. who is the creator of the Forgotten Realms! He posts videos and lore drops alllll the time.
And you'll get a game in sooner than you think, it's one of the funnest things ever 
So in the Realms, everyone sane believes in all the gods, wherefore they swear by either the deities they most revere, or that anger them the most.
So for Mystra, THE goddess (of magic), the equivalent oath would be: “Elminster Farruking Aumar!”
For Chauntea, it would be “Janness Farruking Harvestmother!”
For Bane: “Iyachtu Farruking Xvim!”
For Shar: “Dazhra Farruking Headless!” and so on.
However, in the Realms, the style of holy swearing is more often “By the [attribute] of [deity]”
So: “By the Unholy Madness of Cyric!” or “By The Unfailing Lash of Loviatar!” or “By the Blessed Blood of Ilmater!”
By Mystra’s ass?
By Mystra's Weave-shining ass, please i love this oh my gosh thank you so much for answering my question in earnest!
My pleasure! (This is how I grow the Realms: by adding details folks really want or need. Fifty-six years later and counting )

Aha!
So, the actual word spoken for Power Word Stun is arandguthmuntharcaniss (from:
Arand = core, heart of
Arcaniss = magic
Guth = to push, to nudge, to shove (pronounced “Gooth”)
Munth = stun, stunned (amusingly, munthrek means human)
And the actual word spoken for Power Word Kill is arandguthkurikarcaniss (from all of the above but replacing munth with:
Kurik = slaughter)
But if you instead wanted to cast a spell called Power Word Die, you’d say: arandguthloreatarcaniss (from all of the above but replacing kurik with:
Loreat = die) [pronounced, BTW, "oarandGOOTHloar-ee-attar-CAN-iss"]
And here was me thinking it was just shouting "knickers" real loud. Or is that Power Word, Snicker?
Power Word Knickers creates knickers out of nowhere, that envelop a target creature's head, momentarily blinding them so they can't aim attacks (or use line of sight spells at all).
Sages haven't yet agreed on whose wardrobe the knickers come from.

The way I always interpreted it was that it was a Word of Power that could Kill. Lord Soth's version of it was "DIE!
I dunno. Maybe I just don't look deep enough into it.
My Realmslore replies apply just to the Realms, but in this case to Gary's original lore, too.
Many arcane spellcasters tinker with magic they learn or acquire as treasure; once you have a Word of Power that works, you can modify, so the word you use can be anything.

How does a nerd manage to get all that out before I punch him in the jaw?
And THAT is why a human wizard who gets hold of a Power Word spell using the original Draconic might well spend the two tendays or month or more tinkering with it to transfer its functionality to a much swifter, easier to say word.
Note: nonsense words are safest.

I always assumed the spells implied that you spoke the word with such power that it just worked. Like, you were essentially commanding someone to be stunned or killed by saying very powerfully "Kill" or "Stun"
Gary borrowed the "Power Word" concept from an existing fantasy trope of "Words of Power" (found in more than a dozen classic fantasy novels) in which such words were secret words known only to mages, not "everyday words

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. no idea how mages' sigils are created or if there are any rules, but does this look lore-friendly for Juniper's sigil? It is basically two letters arranged to look like something else and a star for the Art/Mystra
There are rules, administered by the clergy of Mystra, but they are acting as the heralds do, for blazons: making sure no duplications or near-duplications occur (and no "deliberate confusion deceptions"). Juniper's sigil looks fine to me.
Are there any restrictions? Like lude drawings or something like that?
Oh, yes. Huge list.
Sigil must be clearly seen from a distance so no shading/intricate drawings, can't make use of colours/hues, can't resemble any existing sigil closely enough to be mistaken for it, can't suggest a tie/kinship/heritage that doesn't exist, etc
Sorry to butt in, but I’m curious. A topic we’d not discussed, Ed, was an idea that Khelben’s final Sigil was actually a compound of at least two previous sigils held by other IDs of his over centuries. Would that be kosher or only allowed by Mystra’s fiat?

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. out of curiosity, do you have any groups you based on Romani? I’m just wondering since I am Roma and you are my favorite author.
I avoid all direct real-world analogues, BUT I have at least seven groups in the Realms of displaced, wandering folk who have lost their homeland but cling to a shared culture/heritage, and others can see them as a known group (and usually want them elsewhere).
Two descended from Netherese flying city survivors who shunned the society of Halruaa and set out across Toril, lacking all magic but treasured relics and their powerful innate Gift. Of these, Haun Tereth of the Maunatori became a powerful early Cowled Wizard of Amn.
The other of these two groups is the Larantar, who are today farfaring caravan merchants who call their wagons their homes. They were descended from the farmers of Larantau, a now-vanished Netherese demesne that served three nearby flying cities.
The Larantar pass intel to each other, swap goods (especially stolen goods), provide safe havens for any fellow Larantar, and seek more magic for themselves (notably, nursing aged, dying, and sorely wounded mages in return for tutelage).
So this last group would likely most closely resemble the Romani stereotypes of earlier times, across Europe.
In the Realms, the Larantar are inclined to help all outcasts (rebels, persecuted nobles) "just because

Any truth to Earth being the forgotten realm, as the portals that lead to it from Toril or Abeir-Toril were believed to be closed a long time back?
That's indeed the origin of my name "Forgotten Realms," coined in 1966, 8 years before D&D first appeared, though I had Earth historians calling Toril that, for that very reason (which is why we have legends of dragons, etc. but don't meet them in the streets daily).

Thank you so very much for the answer! So I guess that the Gift is akin to superpowers in a superhero setting: some are just born with it while others can develop them through random accidents (even those who were completely normal).
So, in the end, basically anyone has the potential to develop the Gift, but only very few people actually do. And I guess that interacting with magic stuff a lot, while dangerous, would increase the chances of someone obtaining the Gift.
Indeed.
Kids who play in old ruined castles may well be awakening their Gift and not even know it for years.

From what I understand, Ed Greenwood’s campaign never advanced into the Time of Troubles. So does he have his own time-line or just doesn’t advance the years?
I know some DMs don’t care about the passing of years and just run. That’s fine, but I can’t run without a count!
The PCs really "live in" the world: many friendships, businesses, etc. They're BUSY. So the in-world timeline + their levels advance at a snail's pace. The Knights are now average 9th level, we're in the early 1360s DR, and we vote on RSEs: they said no to the ToT.
So do you toss in another event(s) or are things pretty quiet as stories are on a more personal level?
Oh, no, there's a constant cavalcade of "current clack" news from around the world: border skirmishes between petty barons (Chessenta, the Border Kingdoms), trade disputes, and the Zhents and Red Wizards and others trying to topple and replace local rulers. The Realms is alive.
One of my favorite things you do . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. is the “current clack” and latest news. It brings to life so much of Faerun and provides a nigh-endless source of adventure kick-offs.
Is that viewable somewhere?
The original Current Clack is at the end of one of the two books in the Old Grey Box. Later Current Clacks appear at the end of some of my Elminster's Everwinking Eye columns in Polyhedron Newszine (RPGA). I gave out annual Current Clack handouts at TSR-era GenCons.

Agreed! A High Harper is a senior Harper, not a pontiff or president or THE big Harper.
Moreover, in some places in the Realms, the local "High Harper" is a figurehead/target/spokesperson, running interference for the "real muscle" Harpers behind the scenes.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I'm running a session tomorrow using your list of the current Lords of Waterdeep. May I ask, how and why was Sarathlue Serendragon unmasked in 1491?
The cutline for my novel DEATH MASKS is “Who Is Killing The Masked Lords Of Waterdeep?
More than one cabal wanted to put “their” people into Masked Lordships and so end up controlling Waterdeep. One tactic was to assassinate really stubborn/opposed Lords, and  then unmask as many of the rest as you could identify, to scare them into resigning for fear they’d be targeted and slain in turn. Sarathlue was one such unmasked Lord, but she “didn’t scare,” and (as largely seen in the novel) the slayers got taken care of before her turn to get taken down arrived.

I'd love to be a fly on that wall and just see how you develop such!
Here's how: just as in the real world, what are the current flash points (disputes over valuable resources like oil)? And, where haven't we heard from in a long while?
With those in mind, follow 25 important NPCs (Szass Tam, Manshoon, etc.). What are they up to?
Generate a local broadsheet (newspaper) headline about what they're doing, or a rumour about it. How might it get twisted/inflated if retold by a tavern drunk? Gather the 25 results, and there's your current clack. Wars first.
And then the 25 are dropped as newspaper articles/rumors/ect..?
Every caravan passing through a locale brings the latest news. Merchants and crew try to get free drinks in return for telling the tales to the locals. Things get retold and distorted, and the cycle repeats.
Which one of the supervillain immortal evil world-threatening NPC villains would be the most pleasant to have tea with?
Which one would be the easiest to talk out of a lethal encounter?
Depends on you
However, if we include dead as well as the living, good candidates would be:
Tea: Syluné or Shaaan the Serpent Queen and talk out:
Larloch or The Simbul

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. are a thing, created in the usual way most commonly, right? But that does raise the question of what would a dragon seek in a mortal mate, with their way of thinking being alien to most mortals.
Especially some of the less 'personable' types like Reds.
It varies.
Some are curious, many want a respite from loneliness (they want to "belong" while having the security of knowing how personally powerful they are among "soft" mortals), some want to leave offspring and watch them grow and some want entertainment.
I really should write more about the loneliness of dragons. Even the most paranoid narcissists feel it keenly.

Hey . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Me and my friend . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. have been designing & illustrating Forgotten Realms Dragons for quite some time.
We have a burning question when it comes to Half-Dragon designs & aesthetics. Do female Half-Dragons in the Realms have breasts?
Sorry for my tardiness in replying; I’ve been offline with medical, family, and then COVID, but should be on the long road back now.
Male and female half-dragons in the Realms all have nipples, but how much in the way of breasts they have beneath them depends on  individual genetics and the species who are the other “half” of the half-dragon’s parentage.
For human, elves, halflings, dwarves, gnomes, orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, and centaurs, the answer is yes: noticeable breasts. All of the half-dragons  resulting from such unions will produce breast milk that speeds the growth in size and maturity (including, yes, permanent teeth coming in) of young suckling on them, so the breasts aren’t mere “decoration for artists to enhance portraits with
However, some  half-dragons will be buxom, especially if they are fat or burly of build, and some will be sleek indeed (“flat” in human parlance). So a particular half-dragon character can look like almost anything.
Does this count Dragonborn or just Half-dragons?
Half-dragons.
Okay, speaking of Melissa what does Tiefling milk taste like?
Like buttermilk with a hint of cinammon.
My "home" Realms players ROLEPLAY i have a semi-related question - if two dragons reproduce, but in human forms - is the offspring human or a dragon or some genetic mix of the two?
Results can vary, but the offs[ring is usually a dragon who can shapeshift into human form, if either of the parents can shift (as opposed to using a spell to take human form).

Could keeping on studying the arcane and trying to practice the Art on a daily basis despite being Giftless be suitable method for acquiring the Gift eventually? Cause thematically I think it'd make more sense to reward genuine effort rather than leaving it to simple luck.
Many have tried this, down the centuries. For a rare few, it's worked, but not because they were Giftless, but because they finally did something, or reached the right conditions, to trigger their latent Gift.

And also, are there ways to increase the odds of the Gift developing in a person? Like, someone who constantly tries to actively practice and study magic would have a better chance to become a wizard than someone who just chills in magic places?
Yes, trying to work magic has a higher chance of developing the Gift than just exposure to magic.

No mortal in the Realms knows (only what deities have told them). Mortals can't even agree on who is part of the Ancient Brethren and who isn't, let alone their powers. Ao has governance over Realmspace (and deities within Realmspace), though he's not its creator.

Thank you for the answer! It really helps! So you'd say that a truly Giftless assistant to a wizard who works with magic everyday (using items, scrolls, practicing, etc) would have a good chance at developing the Gift?
No. They are NOT "truly Giftless" if they develop a Gift; they only SEEM Giftless, until it manifests.
To answer your earlier multipart question on this: 
Sages can come to understand the Weave more than the average person, through intense study (reading the  accounts of others who can “feel” and work with the Weave), and by questioning the right individuals (Weavemasters and others who work with the Weave or even live in it, as “voices in the Weave,” like Dove and Syluné). In theory, someone who has a latent Gift  (so, NOT “Giftless,” but having no developed Gift yet) could dream enough, and heavily enough, about the Weave, to dimly “feel” it.
Someone who is truly Giftless can only work with the Weave, and come to feel its flows of power, by acquiring and using the  right magic item or items (one that has enchantments that call directly on the Weave for different results, so the wielder must make guiding choices to awaken and control the item). If an item requires attunement, such attunement requires the Gift.
Many “artifacts” (really powerful magic items) hav sentiences of their own, and can guide a Giftless wielder into communicating with, using, and feeling the Weave.
However, all other routes for a Giftless to know and use the Weave require awakening a latent 
Gift, even if it’s only a limited, undeveloped “wild talent

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I have a few questions. What's the process in the Realms for Wizards creating their own "signature" spells? I.e. Leomund's Tiny Hut. How about altering another wizard's signature spell to be your own? I'm playing a Geomancy wizard who just level 13 and I'm curious
Hi!
Named spells in D&D come from Jack Vance’s Dying Earth series, the same place Gary got (with permission) the “fire and forget” magic system from, for D&D. I put it into the Realms before D&D, in my Realms fiction, but the game and the Realms meshed perfectly.
In-game, in the Realms, most wizards don’t ever think of “signature” spells unless they’re non-adventuring spellcasters-for-fees in a big city or crossroads place, who become known for a particular spell they’ll cast for you, like a rat-deterrent or mending or  warding spell, as it’s their daily bread and butter.
It’s considered egotistical to name spells after yourself, but many mages are arrogant and self-centered and do just that. Such individuals usually name all the spells they come up with after themselves so we’ll get Cadleyn’s Balefire, Cadelyn’s Puissant Guardian, Cadelyn’s Scourer, Cadleyn’s Warning, and so on. Most mages are creative only in cutting corners with material components to use what they have on hand, so rare individuals (or liches and others  who have loooong careers) create lots of new spells, and the great majority of mages just tinker with existing ones and make small changes (rather like gamers tinkering with D&D rules). So Mrasjestur’s Fireball and Qotharr’s Mighty Bolt, being Fireball with  different material components and Lightning Bolt ditto, respectively, are the rule and not the exception. Whether or not such a spell becomes someone’s signature spell depends on how much they promote it as such (e.g. teaching it and selling scrolls of it  widely), who else is casting a similar spell and their “reputation shadow,” and notoriety (e.g. “Oh, yes, the spell that idiot wizard used to bring down the balcony and crush the royal family he was working for; I hear he’s still running from all the angry avengers!”). to that end how would a wizard, say james darkmagic iii for example, who's generally regarded as a great wizard but has a ton of "trademarked" spells be seen by their peers? could you have such a reputation that it would offset and people would be like "yeah, fair enough?"
Oh, yes.
In the Realms just as in our real world, trust is the most valued trait in someone Gifted, and being kind, helpful, and understanding right behind. Being powerful, and so, respected, comes after that.
Powerful mages who aren't a**holes are all too rare.

Glace Canyon . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. In Races of Faerûn (2003), a feat called 'Jotunbrud' is introduced, which makes your character a size larger because of Giant ancestry. Can we surmise from it that Half-Giants are or at least were a thing? If so, why have were they  never given a race template?
Yes, half-giants ARE a thing.
Never having been a TSR or Wizards staffer, I don’t know why they were never given a race template.
In previous lore replies about mixed-race “half-people” I’ve mentioned that most such individuals  genetically favour one parent, so a lot of, say, human-giant half-giants are just REALLY BIG (big boned, big organs, big strength) humans, like Madeiron Sunderstone in the Realms, so that may be one reason.
Can they also inherit other traits from their giant side, like a Fire Giant's red skin? Thank you for your reply, sir!
You're welcome, and yes, they can. Half-anythings are mixing enough genes that they can "breed others of their half-kind." Which means recessive genes may "come out" in their offspring, or grandchildren.

Sure. The coin came into existence, long ago, to pay the harbor entry toll of the time (a Realms example of "exact fare") without any currency exchange hassles. A ship captain could use their own coin/barter goods to get a certain number of these coins from city  booths in Dock Ward.
Over time, the toll changed, Waterdeep accepted far more outland currencies, and the coin's name ("toll token" or just "toll") got corrupted into "taol" (thanks to the lilting way it was pronounced by folk from Tharsult and the Tashalar).

This just got me thinking 
Do dragons of different chromatic/metallic/classical have different color blood?
In my own setting they do, but that's because they were literally formed by gods as a 'perfect' species
In the Realms, they certainly do.
Not all who get hold of some may agree, because dragon blood does oxidize and change hue and consistency when exposed to air for long periods or by contact with surfaces and containers made of particular things.

Okay so I’m 4 years late to this discussion, but now I have a pressing question :
Did Elminster go vegetarian after speaking with one sentient animal too many, or does he just really like strong cheese?
El's no vegetarian, but loves certain strong cheeses. Old Cheddars (but NOT chemically smoked!) and Stiltons (eaten with pears, of course) rather than Limburgers and their ilk. NEVER Swiss.
At least, judging by what he devours from my larder, and what he leaves alone.
No Camembert then? scribbles notes*
I do love the idea of Elminster being a picky eater, for some reason - maybe because in a book I don’t have to deal with the fallout XD
El likes fresh, creamy Brie, as a spread on rusks and crackers.
He rummages my extensive larder (well, extensive before he gets there) and makes his own picks, these days.
Did you know those flaring sleeves have inside wrist-pockets for material components and food?
I did not, but it makes sense - he could not only hide tacos and pies in there, a little bat’s dung and sulphur (preferably in the *other* sleeve) and he could cook them on the fly with a little empty air bursting into flame
Yes! Also nuts, and he hooks so many of my little triangular Laughing Cow wrapped soft cheeses that he must STUFF his sleeves with them!
Oh, and wizards use bat forefingers (wing fingers) as toothpicks, and he carries those as wrist-hem-stiffeners!

For #ForgottenRealms questions, . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. is one of the best people to ask!
I'm asking . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. see if they can answer as it's their IP. I doubt I'll get one.
I did over 20 pages of such local rituals and traditions, but WotC has never published, except for one New Adventures of Volo web column. I'll do a video for my YouTube channel early next year.
Most of them are rural "placate local place spirits" observances.
Ed, every culture has old rituals and festivals. Why don't . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. publish this stuff? Are they afraid of offending groups like modern pagans? Their roots lie in the modern world.
I have no idea. I suspect it's for that: afraid of giving offense.
Back in the old TSR days, it would have been: we're conservative Midwest whitebread Christians, and this stuff is WITCHCRAFT.
I had a hard time just getting them to understand polytheism!
I get it. And yet D&D clerics and paladins worship a variety of deities and causes. There's a big disconnect here. . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. needs to take responsibility instead of being silent. Thanks for replying, Ed.
My pleasure!
Yes, I'd patiently explain the pantheons and everybody praying to all deities as propitiation, and I'd get: "Yes, yes, but which god is MY god?"
Expect a Realms vid on some local customs, rites, and festivals in Jan or Feb next year. I hope. :}

Now I want to see Elminster get into a debate about what toppings go on pizza
Being as I know he loves Hawaiian pizza (or at least, has stolen slices of that flavour on more than two occasions), I'm sure he would get into a debat. He also loves "Meat lover's" pizza, but dislikes aniseed in anything (so, no to some sausages).
Thank you for replying. I did not expect that and it made my day.

Oh, yes. Most of the gods of Toril will help mortals work against Lolth, because she's a constant pain to them and endlessly ambitious, so they think she must be curbed and thwarted at every turn.

The Bladur's Gate community is just straight up something else.
Smooth Shadowheart.
Gods favorite princess would never be caught dead with that rodent in her pants. Now she's silky and smooth.
The amusing part is that usually Half-Elves have very little body hair and pure elves have none. (Which implies Halsin has human blood somewhere in his family tree.)
But yep, we are a weird bunch. (Not a modder myself, if I was I would focus on 5e subclasses.) citations needed
It's from pieces of lore I have found over the years. But the best source of concentrated lore is this YT channel. So forgive me if I don't remember exactly where.
Without a direct citation of a core or official splat book from any edition I am going to have to disregard your claim until one is provided.
While the original post was Baldur’s gate related, it seemed your comment was more of an “in general” statement. Where I don’t remember it ever mentioning before.
As BG3 is set in the Forgotten Realms, I was talking Forgotten Realms. Specifically #Realmslore. Thus me tagging Ed Greenwood himself for clarification. Sure, it is silly, but why not?
Elves and half-elves of Toril have body hair, but it's so fine, and translucent in hue, that it can be felt rather than seen unless you're looking past a surface of elven or half-elven flesh at a light source, so the hair is highlighted.

his tenday we r playing around w the most evil thing in the multiverse- beets. several attempts at blood drops- beet chips, dusted with sweet spices and sugar or with hot spices from the south. First step- tossing them with salt or sugar. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms #DnD
I like beets
You must be evil too! mins later, lightly brush both sides with oil and bake to crispen. Sad thing, beets blacken when baked. If the color matters to you, bake them whole first. Then slice and bake again. But that’s just too long. #DnD #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
The color is not very bloody, but now need to make a little oil spray bottle to coat or try to coat them evenly. Red blood drops will be coated in chili lime garlic and red pepper dust. Yellow - sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms
Coating them evenly without a good spray of oil is rough. But blood drops work well as a Realmsian bar snack. . if you like beets. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms still need to try and roast after boiling to see if it works better
REPLY-TO-TWITTER. they don’t look too bloody but does lime, chili, red pepper and garlic mix works in the realms. They are already seasoned and salted before baking.
I would eat those! By the platterful. Yum!
Would they use a frier to make them in the realms?
Yes: metal pan of oil over coals, two or three heavy metal spoons (bowl about the size of your face but straight-sided, and bowl made of metal strips with gaps between them) are rested in it and then lifted out. So, akin to the fryer baskets in a McDonald's.

Yes. Alhoon want to devour brains of mages to gain memories (especially of spell creation experiments), but know each brain “gone” is another Weave access point lost to them. So many instead use spells to dominate and control captive wizards as thralls. Azuth frowns.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hello Ed, I hope you're fine on this beautiful day.
My wife is too shy to ask such a question on public twitter, but I have no shame so I will go ahead and ask for purely research purposes (cough).
Is there an equivalent of Kamasutra in FR? If yes, who penned it?
The clergy of Sharess sell Duth Lavarranka (“On Living Well”), a small tome that covers the sensual life, from bathing and grooming to caressing to relax and bring slumber or to arouse and bring orgasm, and even “Ressa” (prolonged orgasm leading to an altered  state of consciousness: “goddess-rapture”). It has far fewer illustrations of sex positions than the Kama Sutra, but addresses the nature of love in the same way. The priests of Sharess will tell laity it was penned by the goddess herself, but cloistered  temple lore ascribes it to priestess Raethra Nuenna, who wrote it in 799 DR, inspired by Sharess, and as her reward altar-ascended to become a servitor of the goddess at the end of that year.

Where are any Beastmasters, if any, are operating today and what deities would they worship?
I'm away from my notes right now, but here are a few:
Aerhoyn Thultran (“AIR-oh-hin THULL-tran”), a Chondathan male human in his thirties, formerly a cobbler in Amn, now (1500 DR) operates in both the Cloak Wood and the Wood of Sharp Teeth, seeking to curb the  influences there of evil and harmful-to-the-wilds beasts and factions. He primarily worships Eldath.
Chanszellra Ormult (“Chan-SZELL-rah OAR-mult,” with the ‘t’ ALMOST silent) is an Illuskan female human in her mid-twenties. She grew up in Everlund, and is  now active in the northeastern High Forest (the verges), and east into the Far Forest. She primarily worships Mielikki.
Orblan Hethennor is a Tethryian male human in his sixties. Formerly of Scornubel, he now roves the High Forest along the Heartblood 
River, and sometimes ventures into the Greypeaks. He venerates Silvanus more than others.
Rarlvarn Telgor is a Damaran male human in his thirties, who dwells in the Dalakharr (Methwood) in Unther. He primarily worships Nobanion.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Hail and well met! I was very much a pipe tobacco nerd in college, knowing far too much about various varieties and blends. I know tobacco originates across the sea, but are there any big tobacco growing regions in Faerun? I can't imagine wizards without a pipe!
Big” is a relative term, but there are several small pipeweed growing areas in Faerûn. You need sandy (or gravel) soil and a temperate climate. Here are a few: coastal southern Ulgarth, Durpar on the west bank of the Heldar, the shores of the Great Sea in 
Konigheim (the Utter East), near the northern headwaters of the River of Spears in Mulhorand (north of Klondor), just south of the Firward Mountains in Ashanath, and just west of the Tsurlar Forest in the Vast (east of the Stormcrest Trail).
There are many more small local “pockets” of pipeweed growing, as it’s now (in 1500 DR) a companion plant grown to protect some food crops.
Didn't Elminster have a patch he grew near him home in Shadowdale?
It wasn't Elminster's patch; the local old lady who grew it just let him harvest some, in return for occasional cantrips cast (mending, usually) when she needed them. But yes, there were several private patches around Shadowdale.

Ahhh, Konigheim, how many times did I lie & say I went there & got it there, instead of discussing my supply chain.
Usually a melon shoppet, was my contact that panned out.
Heh. Pipeweed is tobacco, not marijuana
Right, but historically, tobacco sources were a high conflict trade market, close to the big police corruption scandals, which would turn into poisoning farms -so confidential sources laws often started with tobacco industry.
Pipeweed in the Realms isn't as addictive as real-world tobacco, and many rural folk smoke local leaves and shoots (not pipeweed), so the markets are different in volume and nature (not illicit in the Realms, not "sin" taxed) than in our historical real world.

Good day to Saer . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. (Steven E Schend appears to have vanished!).
The Cassalanters reinvigorated Asmodeus worship in the early 1490’s. Are there any other families who featured prominently in their new cult?
Not “prominently,” no. Behind closed doors and undercover, YES, but. .they were ambitious wannabe-noble rising wealthy merchant families, like the Dzunborns and Ilindravvars of Sea Ward and the Jarandurs, Maendreths, and Sourntrils of North Ward.
Among the ranks of Waterdeep’s nobles, aside from the Cassalanters, worshippers tended to be wastrel “black sheep” uncles and aunts, the disaffected and usually unwed and debauched elder brothers and sisters not in line to head their house.
Such individuals included Gastorn Brokengulf (NE hm R3); Szelruena Agundar (CE hf Sor6); Ilmur Artemel (CE hm F4), and Naranta Sultlue (CE hf R7).
This is salacious & confounding.

Farl was slim, wiry and strong, had very dark brown hair (looked nigh black), brown eyes, and tawny skin; he was Damaran. Thin-line moustache, close-cropped razor-edged "daggerboard" sideburns, and back-of-neck length hair. Handsome, lithe. Fast grin, likeable.

Just to be clear, is Toril pipe weed more like tobacco or more like marijuana?
Pipeweed grown on Toril is the equivalent of tobacco. Calming and SLIGHTLY deadens nausea and pain. NO hallucinogenic effects unless things have been added to it. So, tobacco, not marijuana.
Thanks! I'm never sure in fiction. Like in LoTR, I think they're smoking weed. Every new setting, that's why I always ask myself, but then there's no one to go to for more info. You're the most informative creative I've ever communicated with
I'm trying to make the Realms ever-deeper in lore, but even after sixty years of creating it, in some places the lore is darned thin. I will always try to "be there" with lore replies, but tomorrow I'll fall silent for a week, attending Gamehole Con.
So what hard narcotics are there?
I've written them up about a dozen times, but most mentions weren't published (TSR had a Code of Conduct, and drug use was verboten). However, some mentions have slipped into print, and can be found in sourcebooks, in my YouTube videos, and my old Candlekeep postings.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. so I was doing a quick search and couldn't find a definitive answer. Is Strahd the first vampire ever? Or were the vampires created by Orcus before him? Ravenloft timeline is weird, because Strahd would be just a couple of centuries old and there are older vampires.
No, there were and are thousands of vampires who are older than Strahd.
So they are indeed the creation of Orcus?
Orcus is a destroyer and tyrant, not a creator. Believe no Orcus propaganda. Vampires are older than Orcus, too.

can anyone who is left on the DnD Side of Twitter help me hunt down a full version of Ever A Hero Be from The Forgotten Realms? perhaps . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. ?
Sure!
Though the sun be hot and bright
Every realm gets dark and cold by night
Somewhere always knows need for more light
To comfort and guide, and perils highlight
And that glow comes from people like you and me
So we need the right folk, to stand proud and strong
To walk the brighter road, be it hard and long
To sort what is right from all fair-seeming wrong
To swell hearts and minds with a better song
And be a hero for you and for me
But deep in halls dark and haunted
Even heroes bold, high-vaunted
Twice and thrice, to end up daunted
Think of loved ones deeply wanted
And much safer places to be
So the life is hard and too often dark
And every battle leaves its mark
Yet the world sore needs their special spark
Their lack is all too clear and stark
So we all yearn a hero for to see
Wherefore if the chance should come to you
To noble cause cleave right true
And through all fell foes staunchly hew
So we weaker sorts will look to you
As you ever a hero be
Hero be
Hero be
May you ever a hero be! (The last three lines are sung slow, loud, and emphatic/triumphal. Ever a Hero Be was a ballad penned by Thalloviir Vaundruth, Bard of Beregost, in 1344 DR.)

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. How would you describe the position of the Endless Wastes on the entire continent of Faerûn? dnd #forgottenrealms
Hi, Ginny!
It depends on the context (i.e. who’s describing). Most far-traveled wayfarers call it “the Bit Between” as it lies between “the known lands of Faerûn and the East (Kara-Tur). Some caravan merchants have been known to call it “a whole lot of nothing
I call it “the Open Country” or “the Unexplored Country” because it’s never been visited properly in published Realmslore and because it’s a huge expanse of rolling, hilly grasslands.

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. I was looking over a copy of the old Principalities of Glantri gazateer earlier this year, and a peculiar idea sort of took up residence in the corners of my mind. Without putting it all out there, is there any chance that there was ever an intention or an idea of connecting Mystara and the Forgotten Realms in any sense through the Principalities? 
It's about the magic users
Yes. Unofficially, so DMs could run a high-level "across the worlds" campaign (like the later Planescape or the Spelljammer novels that involved travel from TSR world to TSR world), but the product lines remained distinct legally. (Magic wielders controlling portals.)

REPLY-TO-TWITTER. What was the world that the Gray orcs came out of like? was it similar to Toril except with orcs being the dominant species? or was it simply a world with only orcs?
It was a diverse world (as Toril is), but generally colder and rockier (many mountain chains, verdant life in ravines and long valleys between the rock spurs).
The orcs there "outbred" other races/ So, akin to the orc hordes of Toril, they went elsewhere in  search of more food (instead of going on being ready food for the many hungry dragons of that world). So the dragons were the dominant species, whereas the orcs were the most numerous.
Does this world have a name or is it nameless.
It has a name but I must check NDAs to see if I can reveal it.
Sounds like a potential setup where the dragons come looking for their missing minions.
It does, doesn't it?

Like the World Serpent Inn? Have one of the back rooms open up onto Mystara? Sure it isn't strictly mentioned that there's a portal there, but I've used it before as a connection. Between Mystara and Sigil and Mystara and Toril
Indeed. :} There are many "backdoor" connections between worlds. Knowing and controlling them (and fighting those who do) was the original Forgotten Realms high-level campaign.

I am something of an amateur expert on the medieval period, and I regret to inform you that I don't think Dragon Age is meant to be historically accurate
We don’t want modern bullshit in a setting that is explicitly less than ours. Imagine doing this in a setting analogous to twenty years ago.

Cool, walk up to Elminster and start talking like a zoomer.
Wut
One of the most powerful pre-established, non-deities in D&D.
I suspect . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. would write Elminster as getting that lingo
Given Elminster does have a portal from Toril to Earth.
I will just say that if anyone uses the word "drip" around Elminster, to him it refers to leaky human anatomy, and not its current slang usage

Greetings, Ed the Grand Sage! 
I don't know if others had come up with this before, but. . I seem to recall that it was either someone else who definitely had a say on a fraction of matters happening in the Realms (perhaps with doubtful precision (2) without access to those powerful mages and such), or the Grand Mage he himself (and that's you!), said something like "Among all the editions, the stats back in AD&D portray the inhabitants of the Realms to the most accurate extend
That set me off digging into materials (3). .concerning AD&D, and indeed, some of the settings were so different from those can be widely seen today. I saw in Dragon issue #91 El's stats for 1E, and in the boxed set lots of other interesting lores.
However, what has shocked me about AD&D are some exceedingly powerful (4) monsters back then that seem nigh invincible, so powerful that almost any attempt I can think of to translate these beings into later-edition versions would seem inappropriate as that would undoubtedly lead to a shrink in their capabilities. On top of my head, I recall (5) . .solars, whose stats in 1E and 2E are, in a word, overpowered.
Though I believe that, in the Realms, no one (or nothing) rivals great mages like Elminster in might, but these beings seem to stand a good chance (6) So my question is. . getting rid of the divine aid accessible to some of the powerful mages, in terms of overall power, does a solar have a fighting chance against anyone of the most powerful mages in the Realms (yeah, I know they're good guys. .)?
Sincerely thanks.
Certainly they have a chance. Solars are of course the D&D version of one tier of angels. I had no hand at all in designing them (they’re “outer planar,” not “Realms”), but the overpowered aspect is due to differing design philosophies among D&D game editions.
In early editions of the game, there were beings who were supposed to be “too powerful” for PCs to defeat; just “out of mortal league.” Later game editions shifted to: gods have stats so your PCs can kill them and take their places.
So some of my early monsters (and a lot of deities designed by many folks) are “gross” in power level. That was deliberate: DON’T mess with these beings through combat. Negotiate or die. Whereas later on it became: PCs can do anything.
Just as Gary’s original D&D was: your PC is this one class, the class has strengths and grave weaknesses, too, so for success you MUST band together in a party and co-operate. Successive editions have moved towards min/max your character can have it all.

When talking with humans, elves, etc. it uses overheard human  names it believes will lead them to treat it as harmless or eccentric rather than something to be instantly attacked, so it often calls itself “Humbert” or “Quilberforce” or “Jannatha

Ao's not the creator of the multiverse; that's propaganda. Ao was installed as Realms overgod by a greater being after the Realms existed; he answers to a greater being, as seen in the published lore. He's not a creator deity or a guardian for either Athas or Krynn.

Jared Melo . REPLY-TO-TWITTER. Ed! I'm DMing in the Time of Troubles and a doubt came in my mind:
When a god dies (like Bane and Torm died in Tantras), does his soul go to the Fugue Planes (or Myrkul's Realm in this time) like mortals that died or somewhere else?
When a god perishes, their soul can wander freely. They fade only when utterly forgotten (no worshippers, and no sentient being currently alive who is aware of them through reading records, learning ballads, etc.).

Sure. Look at old DRAGON Magazines for my incantatrix, smith, beastmaster, etc. classes (billed as NPC classes as there was a rule against adding PC classes to the game without going through the rules committee). Some of these were supposed to be unique to the Realms.

Sonnets got to the Realms through the gates (that are now largely "forgotten," hence the name Forgotten Realms. So, yes, they're structurally the same. I think I've written thirty-some sonnets that have been published, down the years.

Tolerance varies from place to place and with individuals, but "everybody knows" there are "good" monsters. Of course, the first time Person X sees Monster Y, they're not necessarily sure they're looking at a "good" =safe to be near monster.
