?_>' [@] Thanks for the quick answer , but on the wikia it says that the cultures of the Ffolk and Northlanders (Illuskans) sort of merged. I was mainly wondering how that is like? And the Ffolk are said to be a druidic culture but Caer Callidyrr is a city, how would this work? 
+_>'1/8) Heh. Fair enough. :} Okay, a longer answer:
The Ffolk and the Northlanders were traditional foes (the Northlanders regularly raided the Ffolk), but over time, increasing trade-ties and intermarriages (and the dwindling martial might. . [:] 
+_>'2/8) of the Northlanders, that made raiding at will increasingly seem obviously foolish to them as it was clearly sailing to death) made raids fewer and fewer. That, coupled with a decade in the mid 1300s DR of harsh winter/shortened 
+_>'3/8) growing seasons and therefore food shortages and therefore starvation or cooperation to survive, made the two peoples increasingly live together and work together. So the peoples did merge. Northlanders fish and sail merchant 
+_>'4/8) voyages more than the Ffolk do, as the Ffolk remain more “tied to the land.” Yet the Ffolk dominate the shared culture because of their numbers, their close connections to the land, and their skills (they’re better at providing food 
+_>'5/8) and water, medicine, and shelter). The Ffolk still cringe at cities that pave and despoil and have no green growing things, and no wildlife. So, Caer Callidyrr is a city built around the original castle that, like their other 
+_>'6/8) settlements, has plentiful gardens, cobbled streets with herbs and moss growing between the cobbles, many growing grass roofs on buildings, fences made of living vines over frames, many hedges, and abundant resident wildlife that the 
+_>'7/8) citizens co-exist with (and kill for family stewpots). {Silverymoon on the mainland is a larger and more beautiful city that’s also green, growing, and “lies gently upon the land” rather than crowding and paving everything 
+_>'8/8) The Ffolk live WITH the land rather than “imposing upon it.” The Northlanders have no disagreement with that, because they’ve seen that it works. And as the years pass, Ffolk and Northlanders more and more become one.

Tue Nov 13 04:32:38 (Blackstaff, Laeral, Open Lord, Piergeiron, Realmslore, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian, Waukeen, the Deep)

?_>' [@] One of my players for an upcoming W:DH campaign is a Cleric of Mask who pretends to be a cleric of Waukeen and seeks to gain money to buy his way into the Gray Ribbon. Any cool ways I could incorporate this particular faction in the story? Information on how they are? 
+_>'1/10) In Waterdeep, the Gray Ribbon is officially absent, and in truth maintains a VERY low profile: spying more than anything else. Past Open Lords (Piergeiron in particular) and the current one (Laeral) have moved swiftly and
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2/10) ruthlessly to smash even small thieving cabals (the policy being: “There will be no more thieving guilds in Waterdeep. Period.”) and they have been aided in this by the Blackstaff (no matter who it is at the time) 
+_>'3/10)
Elminster, Mirt, The Serpent (Elaith Craulnobur), and many Waterdhavians who have connections among fences and smugglers. In other words, they have been thorough and effective. The Watch can’t stop thievery in the Deep 
+_>'4/10) but they can sure by all the Watching Gods stamp out any thieving organizations (including street gangs of above a certain strength and reach). The lawful guilds of the city all enthusiastically aid in this, as do the 
+_>'5/10) nobles, because EVERYONE stands to lose if there’s an effective thieves’ guild operating and rooted in the Deep. The Xanathar survives and succeeds in small part by being “too deep down” to effectively eradicate, and in 
+_>'6/10) and in large part by maintaining iron discipline that prevents the Xanathar’s operatives from becoming so big a nuisance that they need to be eliminated, no matter the cost.
The Circle of the Gray Ribbon may be many 
+_>'7/10) things, but “stupid” isn’t one of them. Seeing that there’s “no room” in Waterdeep to establish any presence beyond a religious one, they instead treat the Deep as a “viewing gallery” where all they do is watch. Watch

+_>'9/10) in secret chapels in cellars, attics, and the like) in Waterdeep. So, your cleric is on his own in anything he does to gain coin in the Deep, but will be watched and judged continuously, by more than three spies at all 
+_>'10/10) times. The Circle will strongly disapprove of anything that brings unwanted attention to the clergy of Mask or the Circle, but otherwise will merely appraise his performance as a thief, swindler, and (gasp) legit trader.

Sat Sep 29 15:01:17 (Chondath, Cormyr, Realmslore, Sembia, Suzail, the Realms)

?_>' [@] I will be thrilled with anything you can provide! Thank you for all you do for the Realms fans - you are truly appreciated! 
+_>' [@] It's my pleasure! I'm always happy to talk Realmslore, though occasionally I have to keep silent or omit so as not to harm or trammel something coming up for the published Realms. Should be able to get back to you here in another 6 hours or so. 
+_>' [@] 1) Hi! Your request that I share Highknights active into Alusair’s regency was helpful; it sent me to younger Highknights in my notes, rather than those featured in past stories and game lore. I was going to give you notes on four 
+_>' [@] 2) Highknights, but tweet length is making this WILDLY long, so let’s start with three. So here we go
Halantha Bowdragon (CG hf T7/Ftr2), a young street urchin and former sneak-thief of Suzail, who came to the notice of Laspeera when she 
+_>' [@] 3) was captured in an upper bedchamber of a noble’s city mansion with the aid of a hold person spell cast by Laspeera during a murder investigation (the starving-at-the-time Halantha wasn’t involved in the killing, but was opportunistically 
+_>' [@] 4) visiting to thieve a lady’s evening snack while everyone was, Halantha thought, downstairs, involved in “the excitement”). Halantha was a raven-haired, dark-brown-skinned, butter-brown-eyed woman from Chondath who stood about four feet 
+_>' [@] 5) tall and was as “thin as an eel.” Agile and an expert climber, she had sharp eyesight and hearing, and a shrewd mind, and spent her youth living by her wits on Suzail’s rooftops, after her ship-owning parents died of a shipborne fever 
+_>' [@] 6) en route to Suzail. Although lawless and self-reliant by nature, she soon befriended Laspeera, and then adored and became fiercely loyal to her, willingly serving as a Crown spy and later a formal Highknight who often posed as a child 
+_>' [@] 7) when “undercover.” Much of her career was spent spying in Cormyr and Sembia on behalf of the Crown of Cormyr.
Possessed of a great natural gift of personal balance, she was good at jumping, scaling buildings, and other aerial acrobatics, 
+_>' [@] 8) including catching things without falling and landing on balconies or slowing her falls by means of downspouts and fastened-on exterior building ornaments, and became good with hurled knives, slung stones, and handy rocks. Alusair liked 
+_>' [@] 9) to make use of her as a spy in the Royal Court (i.e. among Crown courtiers) and upon highborn and wealthy households, often as an assistant to legitimate tradesfolk like house painters, plasterers, roofers, carpenters, and deliverers 
+_>' [@] 10) for bakers, butchers, and grocers.
Thalvur Handcastle (LN hm Ftr11) was the homely, tall, gangling son of a Purple Dragon veteran (mother; she rose to the rank of lionar, and was stationed in High Horn until wed, when she had seniority 
+_>' [@] 11) enough to transfer to Suzail) and a Royal Court clerk (father), inheriting his height and build from his father. Thalvur was much bullied because of his looks, and became a shy, withdrawn man of few words, but he missed seeing and 
+_>' [@] 12) hearing very little, and after impressing his father several times with his ability to recall writing seen at a glance when passing a desk without slowing, and scores of gems and other small items on display in a room he merely hastened 
+_>' [@] 13) through, his father privately approached Mage Royal Caladnei and let her know of his son’s gift, in hopes of finding him a place at Court. Caladnei saw the lad’s potential utility in spying for the Crown, and he was covertly recruited 
+_>' [@] 14) into the Highknights (via a process that tested his honesty, loyalty, and strengths and weaknesses, without revealing his father’s approach to the Mage Royal, or even her knowledge of his existence, to Thalvur). Thalvur impressed the 
+_>' [@] 15) senior Highknights of the time as someone who kept secrets, was silent and humble and a perfect “hand of the Crown” (we might say “team player”), and so made a perfect assistant for many Highknights on missions (Thalvur was perfectly 
+_>' [@] 16) content to stand watch or act as a rearguard, and never grew bored or restless, so he remained still and silent if need be, or “in role” if called on to pretend to be a merchant or delivery-hand, and stayed alert at all times).
These 
+_>' [@] 17) qualities, and his performance—never screwing up, and often noticing things that proved very useful—very quickly made him a trusted Highknight, and his many, many deployments soon made him a senior Highknight. He had no personal life, 
+_>' [@] 18) beyond a fascination with the map collections of the Palace and a delight in dropping by the kitchens to hear cooks and platter-maids banter and sass each other, and so, soon put in more “active time” than many Highknights years his 
+_>' [@] 19) senior.
Varland Hornrel Luthgard was the bastard son of a young Hawklin nobleman, and a commoner mother distantly related to the now-extinct Cormyrean noble house of Tavernant. Darkly handsome, cat-graceful, arrogant, slender, and sharp 
+_>' [@] 20) -tongued, he got into scrape after scrape growing up in Suzail with his “installed in upper rented rooms in Suzail for cuddling purposes” mother, until his father lost patience and forced him into a role we would call a “remittance man” 
+_>' [@] 21)—so long as he stayed away from his mother and father, and told no one, ever, of his parentage, his father (Bracehelm Hawklin, the youngest-but-one of six brothers, so far from being the Hawklin heir) would pay him 20 gp/month (via a 
+_>' [@] 22) particular innkeeper; Varland was to pay for a room one night a month, and receive his coins in person, privately, behind its locked doors) to live on. “Luthgard” was the surname Varland invented on the spot, once this arrangement 
+_>' [@] 23) began.
Varland was vain, a dandy in his dress (preferring florid takes on current fashion), and liked to drink. He had a fondness for gambling, but knew he dared not partake due to his limited funds, and so instead cultivated wealthy 
+_>' [@] 24) and noble friendships, so he could attend feasts and revels as an invited guest. This meant he had to willingly engage in pranks and other shady-work that those he was seeking to make and keep the friendship of were “up to,” and got 
+_>' [@] 25) into trouble from time to time thereby, earning him the suspicion of Suzail’s Purple Dragons, certain courtiers, and Highknight spies. The latter started covertly investigating him to make sure he wasn’t an agent for any foes of the 
+_>' [@] 26) Crown, found nothing except that he was drifting and dissatisfied and so could become a potential danger, and noted the potential usefulness of the social network he was developing.
So they sent Jhantra Spurbright, a bored, elderly, 
+_>' [@] 27) lonely noblewoman who was a personal friend of Queen Fee (and one of her Blades) to seduce Varland, and recruit him. It went very well, and the two, despite their great difference in ages, became genuinely fond of each other. Jhantra 
+_>' [@] 28) became Varland’s confidante and mentor until her death, and was the making of him—she taught him patience and to bridle his temper, and showed him his worth and that he could win a (high) place in the world.
Without telling him what 
+_>' [@] 29) was happening, various courtiers gave him personal secretive missions, for pay, in Crown service, to test his morals and loyalty to the Dragon Throne, the results pleased Jhantra, and Varland was quietly recruited into the Highknights, 
+_>' [@] 30) but remained undercover. The Crown sold him a house in Suzail for a single silver coin (through intermediaries, of course, and sharing the price with no one), put him on the payroll, and let him go on being an idle friend to nobles 
+_>' [@] 31) except when he regretfully had to go and “make money” by trading here, there, and everywhere (really, of course, he was going on missions as a Highknight). Varland remained a caustic, sarcastic wit and flirt throughout, developing a 
+_>' [@] 32) a prodigious tolerance for drink and great quantities of fine food.
Whew; my tweeting fingers are getting weary, so that’s three Highknights done, and that’s also all for now. ;} Enjoy! (And please let me know if any of these tweets don't reach you or arrive garbled )

I have two questions: what can you tell me about the skull "lords" of Skullport? Are they related to the Circle of Skulls of Pharra's Alley? 
?_>' [@] 2. What can you tell me about Abeir's equivalent of Waterdeep? Is there something there? 
+_>' [@] 1/2) Hi! Okay, The Skull Lords of Skullport are detailed in the 2e sourcebook by Joseph Wolf cleverly entitled "Skullport," whereas the (unrelated) Circle of Skulls are described in the novel "Circle of Skulls" by James P. Davis. If you can't find the former, Google

Sat Nov 03 18:57:45 (Ardeep, City of Splendors, Halaster, Undermountain, Waterdeep)

?_>' [@] Great Sage, I was wondering if you could provide some insight on on ancient waterdeep, like when the Shoons (Specifically the 3rd and 4th were in power) 
+_>'1/6) The best QUICK overview can be found on p7 of the 3e City of Splendors: WATERDEEP tome penned by Eric Boyd. The short answer is: there was no city of Waterdeep at this time.
During the reigns of the third and fourth Shoons, . . [:] 
+_>'2/6) the plateau above Deepwater Harbor, and the harbor shore, were being farmed by Illuskans who’d spread from the city of Tavaray (at the mouth of the River Delimbiyr). Earlier, they’d come from Ruathym, fleeing civil strife there. 
+_>'3/6) Halaster Blackcloak and his apprentices arrived in 168 DR and built a tower, Halaster’s Hold, at the heart of the plateau. It also became known as Blackcloak Hold, and the latter name clung to the settlement that grew up around it 
+_>'4/6) . .among the farms. Halaster built the hold as his base from which to wrest what’s now known as Undermountain from the drow, and he and the Seven (his apprentices) were busy doing so until well after the end of Shoon IV’s reign 
+_>'5/6) . . (the Seven “went below” in 307 DR). So while the Shoons were, ah, “flourishing” (not a word most of their subjects would have agreed with), what would become Waterdeep was an increasingly productive and prosperous farming 
+_>'6/6) . . community trading with Tavaray (mainly overland, by mule-train). Orcs and hobgoblins lurked, but the drow and the elves of Ardeepforest kept them largely at bay, and once Halaster was in residence, he kept the drow at bay. 
+_>'Afterword: If you want “Waterdeep” to exist as a name (a town), you need to be at 900 DR or later, which is well after the last Shoon achieved lichdom, faked his own murder, and went into hiding.

Fri Dec 07 05:44:28 (Blackstaff, Netherese, Realmslore, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian, Zund, Zundbridge, Zundkeep, the Deep)

?_>' [@] Well, now it’s almost finished! Thank you so much for the directions! Also, we are working on a Homebrew adventure there, could you give us any ideas of intrigues and rumors? [:] 
+_>'1/28) Circa 1280 DR, the wizard Zund used a stone golem to build Zundbridge, and many folk down the years have searched for the golem, many clinging to the belief that it’s buried in the height crowned by Zundkeep (or even
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2/28) . .hidden under the courtyard of the castle itself). A few even believe it stands ready to this day, upright and inside a bridge pier (it will free itself by shoving one of the bridge slabs above it upwards, when commanded). 
+_>'3/28) Unfortunately for would-be golem owners, the golem (with its commander, Zund) are long gone. However, the many searches over the years have resulted in little abandoned dug pits here, there, and everywhere on the 
+_>'4/28) . . riverbanks and the slopes below the keep—and that softened, disturbed soil has been tunneled into by badgers, ettercaps, and a vast menagerie of small furry foragers and predators. Sightings of which have in turn led to 
+_>'5/28) . .many local rumors that there’s a “monsterkeeper” resident in a concealed cave nearby: a crazed human hermit who breeds monsters for companionship and as guardians, to keep folk away from him. This rumor was false, but 
+_>'6/28) . . became true in recent years: a hermit living wild found his snares in this area nigh always full, and moved here to take advantage of the ready meat food supply. Digging out a cave large enough to keep the rain off him 
+_>'7/28) . .in summer (in winter, he walked to Waterdeep to live wild there, as the heat given off by various city activities, or digging into the dung-heaps outside most stables, and sleeping within them, is enough to keep him from 
+_>'8/28) . .freezing to death), he broke through into a small underground tomb-complex, which is now his home and where he breeds fungi and small furry critters (predominantly the human-hand-sized Greater Vole) for food. Some voles 
+_>'9/28) . .escape, and their scurryings lure wild predators to the vicinity. Which in turn has given rise to rumors of Zundbridge having a resident deepspawn; a gate or planar rift linking with a teeming-with-wildlife-because- 
+_>'10/28) -uninhabited-by-humans-or-goblinkin world or plane; a wild magic area that sharply increases fertility, or a crazed resident druid who frequently uses magic to make one critter into three or four.
Smugglers made heavy use 
+_>'11/28) . .of Zundkeep as a sheltered-from-the-elements goods-drop in the days before Waterdeep took an interest in garrisoning it, and they persist in trying to do so even now, hoping that the presence of the Deep’s soldiers and 
+_>'12/28) . .patrols will keep safe what goods they can hide near or in the castle. Several stones on the outside keep wall on the side away from the river were levered and clawed enough out of position to create a small cavity 
+_>'13/28) . .behind them, the gap being “mended” with rocks gathered from the wilderland hills around, and in this small space sacks of coins and trade-bars and the like are often left—or cryptic coded messages directing those “in 
+_>'14/28) . .the know” to where, nearby, goods are cached.
Many outlaw bands use Zundkeep as a landmark without ever approaching it, and one of these bands (the Brown Gauntlet) includes a mage who casts dancing lights and similar 
+_>'15/28) . .spells to illuminate the heights of the keep with different hues and patterns of light as night-signals to allied outlaws, fences (buyers of stolen goods), and trading contacts.
This has in turn led certain folk ignorant 
+_>'16/28) . .of the presence of outlaws locally to believe Zundkeep is either haunted, or alive with fey magic, or is even built over a tomb crammed with powerful magic from which magical emanations are “seeping out.” Some of these 
+_>'17/28) . .folk have even mounted expeditions to try to circumvent the Waterdhavian armsmen and try to find and break into this fabled tomb.
Which is likely not under the keep itself, but surprisingly, isn’t mythical, either 
+_>'18/28) . .according to Elminster (and, long ago, Khelben ‘Blackstaff’ Arunsun, too), there IS a long-hidden underground tomb somewhere near Zundbridge, or at least its entrance (a spell-hidden “door” or gate leading to the actual 
+_>'19/28) . .tomb, elsewhere), where there is powerful magic: a Netherese artificer lies buried with his restless, magically-powerful, and in many cases zany magic items.
Another of these outlaw bands active in the Zundbridge area is 
+_>'20/28) . .Zarafear’s Bright Dagger, and Zarafear, a spitfire of a woman who dwells in North Ward in Waterdeep and enriches herself in part due to the smuggling and thieving of her Bright Dagger (whose members use her city home 
+_>'21/28) . .as a “safe house” to hide in, and healing refuge when wounded), is pursuing a plan to work with certain ambitious doppelgangers to replace and impersonate Zundkeep’s handful of permanent garrison soldiers (as opposed 
+_>'22/28) . .to the patrolling majority), so as to be able to have Zundkeep double as contraband storage and a remount stable (fresh horses) for the Bright Dagger, while retaining its role for the city of Waterdeep. On the face of 
+_>'23/28) . .it, it would seem impractical folly to think the soldiery wouldn’t notice something amiss, but the doppelgangers have subtle plans involving impersonating Watch officers and muttering about “secret agents of the 
+_>'24/28) . .Palace,” and involving the assistance of some unscrupulous wizards to work illusions and other spells, to make it all work.
And then there’s a lurking goblin adventuring band who hunt human peddlers and the like in the 
+_>'25/28) . .vicinity of Zundkeep, and have their own designs regarding extending some existing subterranean goblin “halls” (modest tunnels with rooms opening off them here and there) to reach Zundkeep’s dungeons, or at least to

+_>' [@] First off, it's not an official ward of the city, so no sewers (hence: lots of excrement in the streets, with accompanying stink) and no regular Watch patrols (they go in, in force = at least double patrol strength, when they have to go "get" someone or somebody), so  
+_>' [@] darned near lawless. Also adding to the stink: slaughterhouses, tanneries, and many other "stinky" industries are situated in Field Ward, now, because pressure from citizens got them pushed out of other locations in the city. Most buildings are ramshackle, fire-scarred 
+_>' [@] and ill-repaired because firefighting is all volunteer (as in, if your place catches light, you and your neighbors are going to be ALL the firefighting). So brick, salvaged stone, and so on construction is commonplace, with wooden upper storeys that are either new or charred 
+_>' [@] and patched, and in either case sloppily constructed (many buildings have props and buttresses holding them up by transferring force to the ground or nearby buildings). Alleys are many, wide streets are few, but stalls and encroachments are almost unknown (instead, there are 
+_>' [@] many portable carts vendors sell from) because the one thing that will bring the authorities out in force is anyone blocking the streets (traffic must flow freely into and out of the city, between the various gates in the inner and outer north walls of the city). Refugees  
+_>' [@] and outlaws and half-orcs and the truly ugly and others who might be outcasts or unwelcome (kenku, humans with scaly skin) are found in great numbers here than elsewhere in the Deep, and everywhere one walks is mud, mud, and more noisome mud. Want to buy counterfeit docs?  
+_>' [@] Dubious maps? Poisons? Stolen goods? Weapons? You can get such everywhere in Waterdeep, but if you want them cheap and to buy them more or less out in the open, this is the place. If you want to deal with "respectable" citizens or guilds, they shun Field Ward. And most water  
+_>' [@] in Field Ward comes from rooftop catch-cisterns or has to be bought from carts, so it's not a place where bathing is popular, either. It DOES have many taverns and "easy" (no formal registrations or taxes collected) mini-inns (a few upstairs rooms or beds for rent) and clubs 
+_>' [@] And, yes, is very much a clean slate for the game designer and writer, so have fun!

Tue Oct 02 04:22:44 (Trollskull Manor, Waterdhavian)

?_>'So my DM [@] and I were talking and can't figure out *why* Trollskull Alley is called that. Any idea what the story behind the name is??? (Refrain from sharing #DragonHeist spoilers pls!!!!) #dnd [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] can you answer this question? 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 1)
Certainly. Most Waterdhavians “today” (that is, the late 1490s DR) will know only that the North Ward alley has “always” been called that, and may guess it’s named for Trollskull Manor, when the truth is the other way around. Even 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 2) the Palace clerks can’t help, because it’s called that on their oldest surviving deeds and city plans, meaning it was already called that. I can do better, IF we can trust Elminster, my primary source for almost all we know of the 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 3)
Realms in the first place (he’s been known to bend the truth and indulge in spin a time or two, out of whimsy and in service to Mystra, but is “generally” a reliable narrator). So, according to Elminster, the true derivation of the 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 4) name is as follows: in 1298 DR, during the bloody collapse of the Shadow Thieves guild, some of its desperate members sought to cover their escapes from the city (that is, giving themselves time to grab all the riches they could to 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 5) take with them by working with evil wizards of their acquaintance to teleport and release various monsters to maraud in the city, to keep the Watch and the Lords’ agents who were hunting them busy. One mage translocated a foraging 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 6) band of trolls from the Evermoors to North Ward, and they stalked this alley, then known as Lormaundeir’s Skulk thanks to an unsavory local smuggler, Lormaundeir, who lived on it in the 1270s and owned many properties along it that he 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 7) rented out; the tenants were initially unaware that he used secret passages built into the walls of these rented rooms to eavesdrop on them, and learn much, but learned the truth when he died in a secret passage, was found by his reek 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 8) and local tales of his haunting the passages developed.
The trolls slew some citizens along the alley ere they perished in flaming spheres hurled at them by the wizard Tazhara Lurael, of Turmish (formerly one of Elminster’s 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 9) apprentices). She was racing about the city dealing with many released-by-Shadow-Thieves monsters, and lacked the time to “clean up” properly, so some local youths ended up playing with scorched troll bones, bowling with the skulls for 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 10) some years ere they all disintegrated under the rigors of such handling. By then, the rest of the city had dubbed the way “Trollskull Alley,” the name stuck, and many of the locals didn’t mind—because it transformed their reputations 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 11) from folk living with the ghost of a creepy smuggler to folk who’d survived battling fearsome monsters. So there you have it. (And yes, many 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] 12) locals have reported seeing the phantom apparitions of skulking Lormaundeir AND a trio of trolls proceeding silently down the alley. Not to mention the inquisitive ghost of a tressym, though no one knows where it came from.) [the end]

?_>' [@] [@] What’s the rough value of a water-clock? Are there any nonmagical pocket watches or wristwatches? 
+_>' [@] [@] Water-clocks are still large, cumbersome, and expensive: 1000 gp and up for a commercial one, depending on how ornamental it looks. An artificer could make their own for as little as 200 gp (400 if they have to buy everything from scratch). Clockwork pocket watches are fist 
+_>' [@] [@] -sized and heavy, and some can be bought strapped to bracers, but if you're not a half-orc or half-ogre, they're going to feel MIGHTY heavy on your wrist. However, wristwatch "stopwatch equivalents" DO exist, in the form of precise-time fuses (developed by dwarf and gnome  
+_>' [@] [@] miners centuries ago: you "wear" a wrist-fuse on a metal plate (so your clothing, hair, and skin won't suffer), light it, and have a 1- or 2- or 5-minute "timedown"). This is used underground, and/or in smoke/fog/mist, to time how long it is before it's safe to go back to  
+_>' [@] [@] where something dangerous and timed (like blasting, using a similar fuse you lit just before your wrist-fused, and running to cover) is happening/about to happen. Smaller pocket watches are being developed all the time, but thus far the fashion is to wear them around the  
+_>' [@] [@] neck on a chain (rich merchants, nobles, and even busy warehouse managers are popular practitioners of this), not at the wrist, because in the Realms, many who work with their hands wear bracers or garments with cuffs that store lockpicks, drill bits, finework hooks 
+_>' [@] [@] needles, and the like "handy" at the wrists, so the real estate is already spoken for
Water-clocks may be large, part-fountain, play tunes or move ornaments (figures that turn, strike bells or gongs, etc.), and take the form of large central-grand-room-feature sculptures.

+_>' [@] Of course! Fire away! 
+_>' [@] 1) I started writing stories at the age of 5, sequels to everything that caught my fancy in my dad's den, because it was full of books by authors who had died, so whenever I asked my dad for "the next book after this one," he told me I'd have to write it myself. I loved swords&amp 
+_>' [@] 2) ..sorcery tales, and started writing my own, starring Mirt the Moneylender; those stories developed into the Forgotten Realms, about ten years before D&amp;D existed. I also loved games, including wargames (Donald Featherstone miniatures games and board games), so when D&amp;D came  
+_>' [@] 3) along, I tried it. A STORYTELLING game, that goes on and on! Cooperative, no one "winner"! What's not to like? The initial rules were too full of holes to grab my friends and I for lasting interest, but then came a wonderful woman named September (who soon died of cancer) 
+_>' [@] 4) ..who got me hooked on "acting" roleplaying, and then came 1978 and the Players Handbook to go with the Monster Manual, codifying magic (a la Jack Vance's Dying Earth spells) to go alongside the MM codifying many cool monsters. I was hooked, and converted the Realms to match 
+_>' [@] 5) ..and started playing regularly. And have gone right on playing regularly since then. So the Realms is older than D&amp;D, and started as a way for the very young me to entertain myself (and my dad and his work friends) with fantasy stories. I started writing for "The Dragon 
+_>' [@] 6) magazine in 1979, flooded it with articles and soon got named a Contributing (later Creative) Editor, and have worked on the Realms every day of my life since I was 5 (I'm 59 now). Never on staff at TSR or Wizards, but for years had a full-time staffer's writing workload.:} 
+_>' [@] 1) Yes. I started writing for The Dragon to do new monsters, magic items, and spells for my Realms campaign (it felt fairer if they'd been published, when I threw them at my players). TSR designer Jeff Grubb ( [@] ) read Dragon, thought of the Realms when TSR wanted a  
+_>' [@] 2) new D&amp;D world, and phoned me up and asked if I had a big detailed fantasy world at home, or made it up as I went along, and I said "yes" to both. ;} That soon led to TSR buying the Realms, and, yes, changed my life: I ended up writing the Realms full-tilt for decades 
+_>' [@] 3) Beat my "real job" all hollow 
+_>' [@] I love them all and have written for/in them all. They're all different; the Realms is a broad "big tent" that can accommodate all sorts of playing styles and settings (jungle, arctic, pirates, Underdark, etc.) and most of the other D&amp;D worlds have a more specific focus. And 
+_>' [@] of course, they're all linked, if you want them to be; your campaign play can rage through them all. :} 
+_>' [@] It's happened already. Two ways: Planescape (and the various Manuals of the Planes before the setting) and Spelljammer. Jeff Grubb was a lead designer on at least 2 of those 3, and I did design work on them all great and wacky fun! 
+_>' [@] Decide before you start what style of play you're doing it for (battle? intrigue? roleplaying merchant-explorers?), and what you want the setting to accomplish (published setting? cradle for a long-running campaign? backdrop for a series of mini-campaigns?) and what style of  
+_>' [@] setting you want (medieval swords&amp;sorcery? Renaissance era? Steampunk? Planar travel? Grimdark? world war going on, or prosperous peacetime and the PCs can be swashbucklers?), and then start designing accordingly. Settle these things, then start with a main play-start locale 
+_>' [@] and build outwards, but don't let worldbuilding take over your playing and fun time. Build what you need to start, decide on directions, then let the players participate and make your world richer. 
+_>' [@] Been awhile since I've played that system (not since Gary was DMing me at a convention). Enjoyed it under him, but haven't enough experience to voice a worthwhile opinion of where it's gone since.
Must run now; time to make tea for my wife and then get back to writing! 
+_>' [@] I seem to remember [@] (then Creative Manager for TSR) has a fleeting cameo role in that VHS 
Yes, catch you later! I try to get on Twitter twice a day, and send out a few tweets each time, but life tends to be hectic, these days

?_>' [@] Greetings from England! I hope this week is going well? I wonder what you can reveal about Rhauntides' Tower? The survivors of the visit to Chondalthripe's tower, are planning on taking an obscure artifact to Rhauntides for his opinions. Many thanks ~GG 
+_>'1) Rhauntides and Shaunil finally accepted elven offers to relocate to Evermeet, and did so, silently slipping away from their tower in Highmoon, likely in the spring of 1382, although they told no one, and even neighbors

+_>'2) . .thanks to the spells they left active, thought they were still in residence.
Their tower was guarded by many traps, almost all of them sequenced spell triggers that discharged arrays of “hanging”-ready spells that renewed

So a trap in their tower wouldn’t be a pit or a deadfall or a discharged missile; it would be several unleashed spells in succession, often of different sorts and set so as to afflict an intruder retreating 
+_>'4) from an initial spell attack.
The Spellplague didn’t destroy these traps. Rather, it twisted them into an everchanging array of weird, wild spell effects, some of them not harmful—but some of them even more deadly than the 
+_>'5) norm, like magic missile and minute meteors volleys that emanate from the body of an affected being, in all directions, not under their control, at random times.
Rhauntides and Shaunil left behind not a single written spell 
+_>'6) or note on magic, so their tower should be a trapfest with very little treasure, beyond domestic furniture (including their “second-best” flying carpet bed). The beings known as “living spells” may or may not be in residence.

?_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] Thanks for the reply!
I ask because I’m homebrewing some rules about operating a tavern in the new Waterdeep adventure. As a food service employee, I’m just wondering what the on/off day ratio looks like
Because a tenday has 3 more days, is it as simple as 1 more off day? 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] In the Deep, it's a "workers market" in hospitality/entertainment because no one guild controls that sector. Most taverns are owned by a live-in family, who are therefore "always there" (some family members, at least). Most have paid, non-family-member employees who work a  
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] 2) half-day shift (12 bells = 12 hours), but those shifts are staggered around the clock for taverns that are open more than 12 hours in a day (=almost all of them). A typical employee would have "four days on and one day off," and if in poor health or elderly and hurting

Sat Aug 04 21:44:16 (Realmslore, Red Wizards)

?_>' [@] Hi Ed, my party are about to travel to Featherdale, and I suspect will want to enter Cholandrothipe's tower. Is there any information you can give about the tower or Cholandrothipe himself? regards ~GG 
+_>' [@] Hi, Gareth! Here we go (warning: long thread):
Cholandrothipe was a short, rotund, dignified pedant who had a long but narrow white beard, piercing emerald eyes, and an advanced case of paranoia: he was CERTAIN the world was out to get 
+_>' [@] 2/him, unknown foes lurking and keeping watch over him at all times, waiting for the slightest weakness or vulnerable moment, in which to pounce.
As a result, his tower north of Feather Falls—a long, thin, diamond-shaped (when seen from 
+_>' [@] 3/above) walled compound of black stone—was crammed with secret passages, traps, and magical guardians.
The long axis of the diamond ran east-west, with a tall dwelling-tower of black stone forming the western point. The northern point was 
+_>' [@] 4/a short granary tower (built over a deep well of clear, sweet drinking water), the southern point was a short stables (with workshops and storage above) tower, and the eastern point was a tall entry tower, home to Cholandrothipe’s guards 
+_>' [@] 5/and cooks, with kitchens and a dining room and their living quarters above; they cooked hot food and took it on dome-covered trays to Cholandrothipe’s tower via an underground passage running underneath the central courtyard, which was 
+_>' [@] 6/given over to a thriving vegetable and apple-tree garden, now run wild and vine-choked. (The tower has a dumbwaiter shaft connecting to all of its levels.)
The walls were forty feet high, the short towers sixty feet high, the entry tower 
+_>' [@] 7/eighty feet high, and the wizard’s tower a hundred feet high. The compound was built on bedrock and so had few underground areas; just the well, the passage under the courtyard, a simple two-cell dungeon (mainly used for growing edible 
+_>' [@] 8/mushrooms) beneath the entry tower, and a cesspit under the stables tower. Adventurers’ reports of extensive underground passages and “grisly laboratories” are the result of a collapse of the floor of the underground passage at its 
+_>' [@] 9/midpoint caused by the Thayans who slew Cholandrothipe blasting naturally-cracked bedrock to try to find “hidden treasure” that wasn’t there—and breaking through into an older underground complex beneath the tower not known to 
+_>' [@] 10/Cholandrothipe.
This “dungeon” connects in two places to the natural caverns of the Underdark, areas long abandoned by the drow due to repeated flooding and everpresent damp, which makes them fungi forests roamed by many wild creatures, 
+_>' [@] 11/large and small, of the Underdark. The fungi are slowly colonizing the subterranean complex, expanding to carpet everything with spore-ridden soft growths, including the “grisly laboratories” which were constructed here by a renegade 
+_>' [@] 12/apprentice of the archmagi Mycontil who fled here from Halruaa in 584 DR to work on augmenting and transforming humans by magical means (successfully grafting onto them living crab-pincers, scales, prehensile tails, and extra beast-eyes 
+_>' [@] 13/capable of darkvision, and with only sporadic success arm bone-spines, fangs, and tail stingers). The apprentice, a megalomaniac mage by the name of Izander, considered humans who did not have the innate ability to wield arcane magic 
+_>' [@] 14/to be “lesser” beings, that wizards had the right to enslave and transform. He eventually died here at the hands of his creations, because his attempts to magically alter their brains so they’d serve him with unbreakable loyalty, to 
+_>' [@] 15/the point of unhesitatingly sacrificing their lives at his whim, failed—and as he invariably altered them without bothering to abate the pain of doing so in the slightest, so that most of them died of shock after suffering acute 
+_>' [@] 16/agonies, eventually some of them broke free, turned on him, and slew him (literally tearing him apart). A few descendants of some of these transformed humans still roam this dungeon level and the nearby Underdark.
Cholandrothipe 
+_>' [@] 17/magically specialized in magically altering items in size without damaging them (he made his daily living miniaturizing barges and skiffs for “passage past the Falls” and then returning them to proper size, so the River Ashaba above 
+_>' [@] 18/the Falls could be navigated. However, he also enjoyed and collected traps (mainly of the trapdoor and “peril swinging back and forth on a line,” like a long-ram appearing out of a wall to slam intruders against an opposing wall, sorts; 
+_>' [@] 19/he disliked poisons, gases, and piercing features), and became very competent in the making of guardians, such as animated objects (animated armor, flying swords, and rugs of smothering), iron golems, stone golems, helmed horrors, 
+_>' [@] 20/shield guardians, and automatons of his own devising (at least one of which resembles a Slaughterstone Eviscerator). Many of these survive (and function!) in his abandoned tower and the underground areas below to this day, because 
+_>' [@] 21/Cholandrothipe’s slayers fled or perished long before they could “scour out” his complex.
Very few of another sort of trap he lavishly equipped his tower complex with survive: spell-traps. Most of them have “gone off” and so been 
+_>' [@] 22/discharged forever, though a few still wait, silent and deadly, for someone to trigger them.
Cholandrothipe died in spell-battle against nine or more Red Wizards, killing at least three of them before he perished. Another five fell to 
+_>' [@] 23/his traps as they explored his complex after his death. At least one survivor fled, never to return, and warned other Red Wizards that a more thorough exploration of the place just wasn’t worth it. Some, of course, didn’t believe in 
+_>' [@] 24/this warning, and paid the price—as have many adventuring bands in the years since, until now few dare to even approach the tower complex closely, and it’s become utterly overgrown by thick, tangled forest, a haunt of birds and wild 
+_>' [@] 25/woodland creatures.
Cholandrothipe’s servants all died or fled in the initial Thayan attack, and their descendants would be hard to trace today. They did, however, bolster the legend that somewhere in or under Cholandrothipe’s home are 
+_>' [@] 26/powerful magic items, perhaps even an artifact or four, because Cholandrothipe liked to collect such things and dream of enhancing, combining, and improving them. Perhaps, in a few cases, he did 
+_>' [@] 27/And there you have it. Potted Realmslore. Have fun!

+_>' [@] please feel free to use this Realmslore, with my blessing:
The Realms is home to many, many teas and tissanes. Just a quick glance at the front display in Chathala’s Teashop in Saerloon yielded this handful of teas, sold loose-leaf (by weight, dispensed in tiny 
+_>'drawstring silk sacks):
Avlat (leaves of a ground vine plentiful on wild, poor-soils ground; yields a bright copper colored brew that is peppery and very much an acquired taste; when mixed with wines, sauces, and ales, it clears out any sediment/cloudiness and makes them  
+_>' thicken and feel more robust on the tongue and in the belly)
Blackthorn (leaves of the common blackthorn shrub; has a mushroomy, woody taste with a tart berry tang aftertaste; settles the stomach; a ‘standard’ drinking tea of the Dragon Coast and Dragonreach lands) 
+_>'* Blueleaf (the blue leaves of bitterhedge, a shrub planted in Cormyr, Sembia, and around Berdusk, Iriaebor, Elturel, and Scornubel as field=border hedges, because it repels some leaf-eating moths and other crop parasites; cheap and plentiful, and despite the name of the  
+_>'parent plant, yields a bluish tea that is subtly sweet, not quite minty; a favorite with many drinkers; banishes nausea and dysentery)
Chalthorn (the dusty gray, furry leaves of the chalthorn weed so detested by Sembian and Dale farmers; a cloudy tea that has a chalky taste  
+_>' many hate, but that others love not for its savor, but because it deadens all hot spices, so someone consuming food far more highly spiced than they prefer can do so not just without discomfort, but with enjoyment; little-known side use: added to jellies and other preserves 
+_>'..makes them keep, jarred, with full taste and hue for years)
Elkammat (a brown, nutty tea brewed from the fibrous husks of groundnuts in Murghôm, Semphar, Mulhorand, Unther, and Chondath; woody and bitter, but usually sold “adorned” with subtle additions of spices like  
+_>'cinnamon and nutmeg; the right mix of additions can make it delightful; THE standard drinking tea of the eastern Inner Sea, from Aglarond and Thay to the Vilhon)
Jethur (a leathery, mouth-filling purplish tea that’s as savory as a broth, but has an elusive taste that varies  
+_>'..as it it is drunk; made from the tiny purple-brown jethur “carpet mushrooms,” so-named because they cling to sand and rocks as a short, carpet-like covering; some hate jethur, but others will drink nothing else; very popular with merchants, who say it speedily quells the  
+_>'effects of drunkenness, and “settles the bowels”)
Meiriath (a tea much preferred in Halruaa, Unther, and Mulhorand among the wealthy, because it’s always been expensive and in short supply; derived from the leaves of cave-sedge, a grass-like plant found in caves, crevices 
+_>'..and other low-light locales, it must be dried carefully to derive leaves suitable for brewing; a strong-flavored, copper-hued brew that tastes like dried oranges or mangoes)
Talktuth (a gray, metallic-tang brew popular in the North, from Glister to Damara to Sossal, simply  
+_>'..because the hardy talktuth or “groundleaf” plant, a grazing staple of rothé and other snowlands beasts, can be had when nothing else can; an acquired taste and poor seller elsewhere, but any teashop owner will tell you this slow seller lasts and lasts and lasts, yielding  
+_>'yielding decent brews after twoscore years in storage)
Yellowleaf (a cheap, plentiful everyday drinking tea throughout the Shining South because it’s simply the boiled green [that is, no need to dry them] yellow spearhead-shaped leaves of the boiled green [that is, no need to 
+_>'..dry them] yellow spearhead-shaped leaves of the common “yellowleaf” or idaya weed; a thin, “nothing special” tea that had a robust, dependable, never-changing reliable taste; cold yellowleaf tea gets out most stains in most textiles)
Hope these are of help. :}

+_>' [@] 1/The Dragonward (like most powerful wards/fields/guards) is a localized persistent alteration in the Weave (whereas the area of effect of a spell going off is a short-term one). Given time to study the Weave, for those who have the Art (talent to sense, understand, and wield

Sat Sep 15 17:29:30 (Harper, Shadowdale, death tyrant)

?_>' [@] They are looking for Elminster to find lore about things abyssal but an original encounter in their way ti Shadowdale would be great 
+_>' [@] 1) So why not have some Harpers mistake them for Zhent spies being sent to provide misinformation to Elminster, and challenge them?
And the REAL Zhent spies are behind the PCs, shadowing them along the road because they think the PCs are 
+_>' [@] 2) . .Harper contacts going to deliver intel to El, and receive some from him. However, when they see the PCs meeting with the Harpers, they either attack both Harpers and PCs if the PCs are successful in diplomacy with the Harpers (i.e 
+_>' [@] 3) . .aren’t fighting), or if the PCs and Harpers ARE fighting, the Zhents pile in on the PCs’ side (as they know these Harper agents by sight), which will make BOTH Harpers and attacking Zhents believe the PCs ARE Zhent allies. Out of 
+_>' [@] 4) . .sheer happenstance, there ARE some Harper contacts on the way to Shadowdale to deliver a “bone box” to Elminster (a bone box being a coffer made of wizards’ bones that encloses fell magic that ‘heals’ damage to undead, in this case a 
+_>' [@] 5) . .dozen death tyrants used as guardians by the Zhents in various hidden cavern hideholds and storage caches; El wants to not just destroy the death tyrants, he wants to fiddle with the magic to make them attack Zhents who show up at the

+_>' [@] 7) . .survivors, lying bleeding and helpless with the bone box (but able to talk, and desperate to get SOMEONE to complete their mission), somewhere in the forests.
Then build from there depending on how the PCs treat these survivors (i.e. do 
+_>' [@] 8) . .they try to take the bone box on to El? Or do something else?). The Zhents have many passive spies in all of the dales, so whatever the PCs do in Shadowdale (or any other dale, on the roads and farms as opposed to the wild surrounding 
+_>' [@] 9) forest) will get reported to other Zhents. The Harpers, ditto (that is, spies and reporting). From then on, in play, various folk will think the PCs are Harpers or Zhents (or allies), and treat them accordingly. 
+_>' [@] 10)
And when they DO reach Shadowdale, of COURSE El will have some abyssal lore
Which should tie in, in some way, with your plots and tales they walked away from 
Heh. Hope this is of help

Mon Apr 23 03:32:49 (Deneir, Oghma, Realmspace, Toril)

?_>' [@] Awesome, I wasn't familiar with any of them and was wondering if you knew of any? 
+_>' [@] Sure. I'm looking for my notes on this right now. Probably won't get back to you until tomorrow, by the looks of things; the readily-handy notes aren't the right ones (as usual) 
+_>' [@] Hi!
At least four angels/aasimar (devas) serve Oghma the Binder. They are Fabrar, Ilimbur, Marathe, and Sephra, and they can appear alone, or riding pegasi (who also serve Oghma), or (especially when expecting trouble) with bodyguards of 1-4 couatl (who also serve Oghma). 
+_>' [@] 2/They customarily walk, but can fly (gliding upright along the ground as if whisked on a pedway) and blink or dimension door (as the spells) at will. All have melodic voices and usually speak gently. Fire, rot, and mold are all banished (completely extinguished and eradicated 
+_>' [@] 3/but can recur after their departure, if conditions causing them persist or are again created) within a 30-foot-spherical radius around them. All four of these “Servants of the Binder” can conjure translucent constructs of force that look like twelve-foot-tall open books—that 
+_>' [@] 4/can fly and maneuver precisely at their bidding, and upon their silent will-command snap shut, striking anything between their pages with 4d4 force damage, or fly through the air to strike edge-on for 4d6 force damage. These “phantom tomes” can be destroyed by dispel magic 
+_>' [@] 5/and fade away if they ever get more than three hundred and thirty-three feet distant from any Servant of the Binder (so, couatl and pegasi included).
All four Servants can read and write any known written language (and most codes) used on Toril (actually, anywhere within 
+_>' [@] 6/Realmspace), and are familiar with most books, magical and otherwise, of historical cultural importance. They act whenever possible to preserve written knowledge, restore damaged writings, and translate. They are fearless in this service, but steadfast and firm rather 
+_>' [@] 7/than aggressive or warlike. They can assume any creature form they have personally observed in the past, but very seldom depart from their preferred likenesses.
Fabrar usually appears as a tall, burly, bearded man in the elder prime of life, his chestnut-brown beard shot 
+_>' [@] 8/through with vertical streaks (locks) of gray and white. His eyes have pupils of bright white light, surrounded by amber irises (and white sclera). His voice is deep, and he always appears barefoot and wearing ankle-length light gray robes; his feet never touch any ground or 
+_>' [@] 9/floor, but “tread on empty air just above it
Ilimbur uses a likeness very similar to Fabrar, except that he is taller, thinner, clean-shaven, and has raven-black curly hair that hangs in ringlets.
Marathe appears as a tall, thin barefoot woman in ankle-length 
+_>' [@] 10/white robes (but like Fabrar, her feet never quite touch the ground). She has an eagle-beak of a nose, long straight black hair, and thick, severe eyebrows. Her eyes have pupils of bright white light, surrounded by emerald green irises (and white sclera). 
+_>' [@] 11/Sephra looks very like Marathe except that she appears younger, is more curvaceous, and her hair (including her eyebrows) is knee-length and rose-red in hue.
Deneir is served by at least two devas who wear ankle-length robes of many draped, overlapping cloth scrolls 
+_>' [@] 12/covered in writing no current mortal has been able to decipher. They are very like the Servants of the Binder in their specific abilities, but both have curly golden hair worn short, and black irises to their eyes. 
+_>' [@] 13/One is hight Anamandus, and looks male, and the other, Lyruse, appears female. When doing battle or hampering mortals, they employ various glowing glyphs they draw with their fingers in midair, that persist and move (floating or flying) at their bidding.
And there you are. :}

Thu Oct 04 19:03:16 (illicit activities, the Realms)

?_>' [@] Dude, I've already asked this before but I'm Serious: how does the Anatomy of a KOBOLD work? I want to understand it from a Biological Standpoint and you seem to be the guy to do the Job. [:] 
+_>'1) Okay, here we go. If you’re playing the current (5th edition) of D&amp;D, kobolds are small, weak, humanoid-body-shape reptiles: they lay eggs, are clever trap-builders who work together to defeat foes, and have a reputation among. . [:]

Wed Apr 25 00:32:27 (Forgotten Realms, Sea of Fallen Stars, Secomber, Sword Coast, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian)

?_>' [@] Good sir! Secomber I've been able to find information about the Justice system, and the two most popular inn &amp; tavern in there. But other than that, you have any more details about its design &amp; architecture (since no map appears to exist)? 
+_>' [@] Secomber has been mapped by me (every building, in the style I did all of the maps for the 2e tome Forgotten Realms Adventures), and the map is "out there." It's also owned by TSR (now WotC), so I can't legally share it. No, it isn't fortified. Houses have gardens, so there's  
+_>' [@] 2/ room between them, with only a few places (especially around the bridges) where shops with floors of living space above them crowd together wall-to-wall. Thanks in part to this space, the buildings of Secomber (which most Waterdhavians would term "cottages" in terms of  
+_>' [@] 3/ architecture) sprawl "everywhere," on high ground and low (yes, there are older dwellings that get flooded every spring because they're TOO low). Secomber has gardens, trees, fences, and hedges like a country village, and is one of the few larger (and growing!) centers to  
+_>' [@] 4/ retain them. It's also, increasingly, a place for the rising middle class of Waterdeep to buy second homes to go to for "a country retreat" of "breathing the fresh air" and letting children play. Secomber has always been dominated by its halfling citizens. It's also  
+_>' [@] 5/ increasingly popular as a resupply depot/refresher paddock ground/warehousing stopover for costers and merchant caravan companies making overland treks to the Inner Sea [note to Pathfinder folks: MY "Inner Sea" came first ;}, but Sea of Fallen Stars if you prefer] and to 
+_>' [@] 6/ from the Sword Coast North interior. Secomber is increasingly known for its local vegetables and bakeries (and the cuisine that uses them), and for its beer. Goldenfields may be the granary of the North, but Secomber is its bakeshop
Hope this is of help, Stephane!

Mon Sep 10 16:42:20 (Baldur's Gate, Realmslore, the Realms)

?_>' [@] Question which would you say is more canon to the Realms. The Baldur's Gate games or Novels. Both are contradicted by later events. (The Crappy novels that pretty much ignored things more so.) But I would like an answer from you. 
+_>' [@] 1) There is no "more canon than other." There is how we see things differently, or understand what we see differently, or the gods fiddling with what is, turning it into might-have-beens. ;} What I write is canon, until contradicted by official TSR, now WotC publications 
+_>' [@] 2) Traditionally, licensed products have been seen as "a step less" canonical. But really, it comes down to this: in your D&amp;D play, you choose what happens/what's canon. The published canon provides a common framework for us all, e.g. tournament play at a convention. Many  
+_>' [@] 3) elements in the Baldur's Gate games and in novels haven't been contradicted by anything coming later, so they still stand. I cleave to written canon when creating new Realmslore (which I do every day) because it works best for consistency, if that helps

Thu Dec 27 18:35:50 (Claugiyliamatar, Realmslore, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian)

?_>' [@] do you have a great riddle that fit a great green dragon ? :) 
+_>'1/10) Okay, here we go.
The key thing about Old Gnawbone is that she loves the company of humans; the bustle of city life, the energy, the strivings, the intrigues. She likes befriending them, establishing alliances and ties
Realmslore [:] 
+_>'2/10) . .using her human gang to manipulate events and make money (that she doesn’t really care about; she has more wealth than she’ll ever need and doesn’t mind losing or spending it; for her coins are like poker chips, proving 
+_>'3/10) . .her ongoing victories (besting others). She likes helping the lowly and needy, and tearing down those in power (like nobles, the Brokengulfs of Waterdeep being one example). She both fears and likes adventurers 
+_>'4/10) . .following them like an avid sports fan, and refraining from swindling them where she wouldn’t hesitate taking advantage of a noble or rich Waterdhavian merchant or guildmaster. She ALWAYS thinks about her relationships with  
+_>'5/10) . .humans, before all else, and how what she does/what’s about to happen will affect them. I don’t mean she wants to be loved or needs approval, I mean she will act and speak in order to make particular humans trust her 
+_>'6/10) . .more, fear her more, shun her more, want to work with her more, or whatever she’s after (in other words, as DM, use what you know of your players personally to manipulate them). Claugiyliamatar can be polite, friendly 
+_>'7/10) . .even flirtatious or fawning, and will never show fear (and in truth, after all these years, feels little; she hates pain and doesn’t want to die horribly, but beyond that, she’s almost ‘so what’ regarding her own fate). 
+_>'8/10) . .Similarly, she banks her rage rather than letting it boil over and master her, and is more apt to be amused when a human tricks or swindles her rather than lose her temper. But she will remember, and WILL get even. 
+_>'9/10) Her favourite phrases include “I see, and we shall see” and “I wonder. .” and “Have you now?/Do you now?/Will you now?” and “I am always interested in the ‘why.’ Do tell 
+_>'10/10)
And as for a riddle, try this one for a green dragon:
Harder to catch the harder you run
Yours but air, mine like deadly potion
In your last memory I’ll yet be green
In forests the scales of my kin are most often seen (Hope this is of help! Have a great game!)

Wed Feb 07 03:40:33 (Cormyr, Manshoon, the Realms)

?_>' [@] Hello once again, this time not a Manshoon question! :) 
What can you reveal about the city walls and wall towers of Arabal- size/dimensions/use/number of floors etc
Many thanks as always GG 
+_>' [@] 1) Arabal (Tar Arabal) is a wayside hamlet in Murghôm that lacks walls or towers. I’m thinking you mean Arabel, in northeastern Cormyr
And the answer to that is: it depends on WHEN we’re speaking of.
So here we go  
+_>' [@] 2) “Right now” in the Realms, in the 1490s DR, the towers are six levels above ground, and two levels below (the underground levels being “set back” so as to be under the streets that run around the inside of the wall, not under the walls themselves, and connected to upper  
+_>' [@] 3) levels via interior ramps connecting with the ground floors of the towers).
The walls themselves are solid stone, and are braced with interior “flying buttresses” to civic-owned (but rented out, or used to house Crown/civic workers) buildings at regular intervals 
+_>' [@] 4) The walls have a walk along their flat tops, with drainage spouts draining outside (that can be used to pour or spray harmful liquids down on besiegers), and crenelated ramparts on both exterior and interior edges (merlons 6 feet high, crenels 2 feet high).
An onager and a  
+_>' [@] 5) ballista are located atop each tower, under sloped wooden roofs, and can be dragged along the wall-walks to be “dogged down” with ropes at any point for stability, and fire from where they’re so sited. A single trebuchet is sited “half down in” every tower-top, for maximum 
+_>' [@] 6/last) stability.
Back in the 1300s, the walls were five levels/storeys/stories high, and the only trebuchets in Arabel were on the ground, by the army barracks, and operated from there, never atop walls or towers.

?_>'This guy is so bad ass. I need to come up with a campaign to use him in. #dnd [:] 
?_>'So this artwork comes from Dungeon 133, The Age of Worms adventure path, and it’s a type of undead Giant called raam. [:] 
?_>'Anyway. He rules Cairnheim. This is his 4e call out. [:] 
?_>'He also gets called out in 2e’s Drizzt Guide to the Underdark. [:] 
?_>'Want to visit Cairnheim? Okay. You need to get past an emerald dragon first. She’s aligned to one of the Seven Sisters. Dove Falconhand. Dove died recently, (The Herald novel) but if you come in her name, the dragon will aid you. Now there’s a campaign already brewing . [:] 
?_>'The opening paragraph of the emerald dragon entry in 3.5’s MM2 gives us a nice hook for the dragon. Their knowledge of an area is greater than that of sages. This dragon would know about Dodkong. What would that information cost you? [:] 
?_>'Here's information from 3e's Underdark. [:] 
?_>'From 3e's Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting [:] 
?_>'Dove Falconhand is one of the Seven Sisters. In current 5e lore she’s dead, but can appear as a ghost. Her sister is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Sulverhand, by the way. She was friendly with Behrshimmer, who you’d need to get past on your way to meet the Dodlong. 
?_>'Dumb typo. Dodkong. 
?_>'So, what would the end goal be for an stone giant lich? Unite the giants to create an undead giant kingdom? 
?_>'I can run Against the Giants . thst’s a somid start. And the level range matches my desire for this to start at 11. This is for my post ToA home group. 
?_>'Booo. Typos. *Solid start. 
?_>'[:] 
?_>' [@] [@] i’m just going to go to the source. 😀 i love The Dodkong from the Grand History book. What is his goal? I want to make him the big bad guy in a campaign, what drives him, what would be a neat way to use him? How do you all envision using him in a game? 
+_>' [@] [@] 1) I've always intended the Dodkong to be a guy who wants (very slowly and patiently, working "under the radar" for as long as possible to avoid interference from the likes of Larloch and the Srinshee and the Seven) to shatter the dominance of humans, and then elves and orcs  
+_>' [@] [@] 2) after that so as to prevent their rising to fill the power vacuum, so he can "restore" giants to mastery over Faerûn. And at the same time, he would "reorder" the status quo among giants by humbling cloud giants and storm giants, to let the stone and fire giants have  
+_>' [@] [@] 3) their chances to reign. And he would do this in part by manipulating dragons and dracoliches into personal fights with cloud and storm giants, to weaken and eliminate as many dragons as possible ere giants rose to ascendancy.
Not small goals, and not easily or swiftly  
+_>' [@] [@] 4) achieved. But he's all about playing the Long Game. Like Larloch, remaking Toril the way he wants it to be. Fomenting wars amongst humans, widespread slaughter among the drow and all goblinkin, and tolerating only hin, gnomes, and dwarves as acceptable giant servitor races. 
+_>' [@] [@] However, I defer to Tom Costa in this, a superb sage of Realmslore who's contributed much over the years yet remained largely unsung. If he has something different in mind, run with it  (And BTW, what I've outlined here doesn't clash with Storm King's Thunder. Run both at once)

Hm . . interesting answers, Ed. So you kinda envision Lake Ontario as the far west arm of the Sea of Fallen Stars? And you’re somewhere between Westgate & Urmlaspyr? 
Thx for your insights, Ed! I’m sure you get a lot of ?’s about the FR’s corollaries to our world’s geography Heh. I do. And I wince hard at folks who want to draw direct parallels between this or that real-world culture or historical culture or Hollywood version of historical culture, and lands or regions in the Realms. But Lake Ontario, aside from being freshwater and not salt, and >__> a tad colder than the Dragonmere, would be a fairly close equivalent. And I'd be somewhere between Moonever and Urlmaspyr. NOT a direct locational analogy, but the same type of temperate mixed woodland, with weather extremes moderated by close proximity to a large water body.

?_>' [@] What is the official and proper style of address for Waterdeep nobles? "The Honble. Lord/Lady [surname]"? "The Lord/Lady [Name] [Surname]"? And in speech, "My lord/lady" followed by "Sir/Ma'am"? It seems every Realms author has their own ideas on this  
+_>' [@] 1)That's because every Waterdhavian NOBLE has their own ideas on this. (And fashions change over time.) You know the old joke that goes: Q:What do you call a god?/A:Whatever HeSheIt wants you to ?? Applies here. "saer" is what anyone in polite Faerunian society calls someone to 
+_>' [@] 2) be VERY polite them, and is the norm for when you're not sure of someone's rank/status but don't want to offend. Lord/Lady is standard (and "my lord" and "my lady" for retainers, guards, courtiers WORKING FOR the person). "Lady/Lord Summerstar" would be formal, or usual  
+_>' [@] 3) at first greeting, with just "Lord/Lady" thereafter. Some individuals will answer the initial greeting with "Call me X," and it's then polite to do so; a Watch officer about to arrest or question you would refrain from saying X and stick with the formal, as a warning  
+_>' [@] 4) I had actually decided things would vary with individuals in Waterdeep and Cormyr (and with the less formal rulers of the Dales) when writing my own stories, before D&amp;D existed, so it was easy, when we started the TSR published Realms, to convey that freedom/variance via

+_>' [@] 6). .in the Cloven Mountains near Thornwood. And far better-known are the monasteries on the slopes of the Aphrunn Mountains associated with the Emerald Enclave. However, if you’re specifically looking just for treetop elven holy communities, these tend to be small, VERY “secret

In Evening Star, at local smithy, holding a sword minor damaged by a drop or two of green slime promptly wiped off. What kind of prices, you reckon, for fixing?

+_>' [@] (smith would be under orders to do military work first, if wartime or "arming up"); skill of smith (what prices can she/he command normally). Also a factor: how much work needs doing (reforging the blade, or retempering, or basically just buffing or does it have magical  
+_>' [@] treatments to reapply (everbright = doesn't rust and blueshine = glow under moonlight, in presence of lamp- and firelight). If the blade was everbright-treated and the green sline got wiped off right away, the slime probably just destroyed the treatment and pitted the  
+_>' [@] surface, so just a regrinding and retreating is necessary (mage fee of several hundred gp atop minor smithing fee of perhaps 5 to 12 gp, usually about 7). If retempering, etc., push smith's fee up to 20 gp right away. Prices less in rural regions unless REALLY rural = "only  
+_>' [@] game in town" because rural folk have less coin to spend on such things. Higher in or near cities unless fierce competition and in most places in the Realms, the constant demand exceeds smiths' time, so prices stay high and stable. Or are guild-set.
Hope this is of help!

+_>' [@] In the Realms, mages are plentiful; in Asmer (Stormtalons), wizards work for The Heirophar (tyrant archwizard) or die (his smiteserpents kill them). Only the Rheligorn (priests of the Six [only 6!]) gods keep him from ruling the world. So lots more room for swords and thews 
+_>' [@] and then there are the Stormtalons themselves, mists that move to conceal or reveal territory; no one can control them, and they transform anyone entering them. The published Realms is a D&amp;D world, and so matches the rules of the game; Stormtalons is its own setting, and  
+_>' [@] doesn't. Both settings are medieval-cum-Renaissance in "overall" tech level. In Asmer, dragons are "brutes" or they are the Sleeping Dragons (incredibly magically powerful, but asleep under the earth), who just might be starting to awaken now

?_>' [@] Also, can we assume the dead houses as of BT (Anteos, Bladesemmer, Brossfeather, Estelmer, Gralhund, Hunabar, Melshimber, Thunderstaff) have also been restored, possibly as part of Laeral's restoration?
Thanks so much for the Realms! 30 years of enjoyment!

Right, you pose a GREAT Realmslore question, so here we go

And yes, this happened offstage and shouldn't have, but with no novels or DRAGON articles of the old style or regular Realmslore web columns, opportunities to cover this sort of lore are fewer now.

+_>' [@] 7). .Triboar begins to look like a rich, ongoing buffet for a kenku criminal organization: a place to flourish, and enjoy dwelling in, to boot. Add to that a sideline in spying on wounded or exhausted prospectors and hunters returning to Triboar, who could be ambushed outside of

>__> for all these questions you answer. Could you tell me about the major temples of Marthammor Duin? Is there one at Berun’s Hill? 1) There can be in your campaign if you want there to be (the reason for all those legends of a dwarf tomb full of gold; thatâ€™s what humans thought dwarves seen near the Hill were there for), but aboveground the Hill remains bare, a landmark and lookout. >__>
The Volamtar establish tiny â€œrefugesâ€ (sleeping-caves, with cached water, food, tools, blankets, boots, and weapons) in the wilderness, but build temples only in cities. In human cities, these temples can be buildings aboveground as well as cellars below. >__>
Many human cities have modest temples to Marthammor Duin. Their daily secondary function is as a skills exchange, want-list and swap message board/neutral meeting ground for dwarves and â€œdwarf-friends.â€ They tend to be rather spartan stone rooms. >__>
Food and drink and beds are always available in Houses Of The Watcher. Dwarves NEVER use an eye symbol for this deity. Nearest temples to Berunâ€™s Hill: Neverwinter, Mirabar, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Secomber.

+_>' [@] 4/ graves that day. He's best remembered for his simple, low-level fire spell Aganazzar's Scorcher, but his most powerful spell was Aganazzar's Hurlgate, which creates a flying magical sphere under the caster's direction that can scoop up nearby foes, subject them to the same

There. That enough to start with?

?_>' [@] Greetings once more. I've recently re-read Elminster Enraged (I pick up more lore each time I read it) and I have a query about Manshoon- He has Silver fire- Was he given this before the Spellplague? Is he chosen or just a vessel? ~ many thanks ~GG 
+_>' [@] Mystra prepared for the Spellplague as her predecessor did for the time of Troubles: by trying to keep the Weave as stable and present as possible (and her survival/comeback as likely as possible, for she IS the Weave) by vesting more of her divine power in a wider array of  
+_>' [@] mortals than usual. So she had her Chosen, and many others (yes, including Volo; that's one of the reasons he's survived some of his scrapes!) who were "unofficial, almost" Chosen. Manshoon briefly held as much Weave-power as a Chosen, and in the SofS trilogy, Mystra offers  
+_>' [@] him the status of a Chosen--and he refuses it. so that's how he has the silver fire, which is (like spellfire) energy drawn directly from the Weave without incantation ("spellcasting"). Spellfire = raw energy, silver fire = far more precise/controlled energy(firehose vs laser)

Tue Oct 09 03:44:46 (Cormyr, Suzail, Vangerdahast)

?_>' [@] so I accidentally (long story) made a Suzalian major noble
It’s circ 1357, her family holds the position that the published Realms holds for the Truesilvers (her da is the commander of Azoun’s fleet)
She’s a Lliiran cleric &amp; eldest child
How’s Society behave?
Thanks 
+_>' [@] Heh. "High society" generally behaves badly
Seriously: the Truesilvers are one of the three "royal" noble families, hence the court ranks they hold. Anyone else holding those ranks would have to be trusted by the Obarskyrs. Which means they're envied by many other nobles  
+_>' [@] and a lot of social-climbing commoners, and respected (to the point of awe) by rural Cormyreans (Suzailans, Marsembans, and Arabellans are more blasé). Her position in the family (heir) and her church standing would make her doubly impressive (i.e. folk can't dismiss her as  
+_>' [@] got where she was entirely because of Daddy). So she'd be treated with respect, obliquely/politely/VERY gingerly flirted with to see if she's interested by nobles of lesser power looking to wed, and the treatment she'd get from courtiers would range from exactly polite if  
+_>' [@] they personally hated her (because of personal animosity or she was arrogant or bitchy), to eager to help her/include her in revels, feasts, and the gossip vine (if she's pleasant/friendly). There are certain powerful old money noble families (Bleth, Goldfeather, etc.) who  
+_>' [@] are the subtle, quiet foes of anyone too loyal to the Dragon Throne/too friendly with the Obarskyrs, but these nasty nobles tend to get exiled AND Highknights spy on them and protect other nobles from them UNLESS said other nobles get too palsy with them in intrigues against 
+_>' [@] the Crown. Her gender and personal sexual interests have no effect on how anyone treats her except the lecherous elder male nobles of earlier generations, who are leeringly interested in anything female. With that said, Cormyr is an endlessly-shifting webwork of intrigues  
+_>' [@] and factions, so who she works with and befriends, and where she stands on issues, will determine how various nobles and courtiers and the ruling Obarskyrs judge her. If she wants power and influence, all she has to do at this time is befriend and be loyal to Queen Fee, or  
+_>' [@] Alusair, or Caladnei, or Vangerdahast. Doing so (with any of the four) will instantly earn her covert enemies , of course [Hope all of this has been of some help.]

+_>' [@] [@] Heh. Noble of what realm, when in Realmsdate, and how (as in: publicly as an example, quickly or can it be an "accident anytime this month or next," how is the noble guarded/what losses may the assassins expect to take); price varies with such factors. And nobility? Never cheap.

?
Not RAW, Not RAI, but a Lore question: Are item made of Mithral and/or Adamantine metals enchantable or does their innate magical essence block/push out other magical attempting to infuse with the item?
That’s exactly what I was looking for! We are playing forgotten realms and while I will not be handing out magically enchanted mithral or adamantine but I was considering letting players go on a quest for a specialist but wanted to keep canon even if homebrew. Awesome! thank you! A pleasure! (BTW: my "those who know how" phrase means: mithral, adamantine, and various other 'special' substances require unique, rejiggered enchantments to be endowed with a dweomer at all, or a lasting one (i.e. if not done right, they'll be magical for a short time only). 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] [@] Items made of the metal mithral and the alloy adamantine can definitely be enchanted (by those who know how, of course), or we wouldn't have forty-odd years-worth of published official magic items made or partially made of them

+_>' [@] Green knights would be few and far between, but the Ten Towns is one of those places that outcasts and brigands and fugitives run to and people looking for them go, as well. So it's possible. Your paladin could have been sent out from Silverymoon for intelligence-gathering.

?_>' [@] Hi, Ed! Quick question. What canonically happens to souls that are contested between two powers? Like, if someone is a devoted follower of a good-aligned deity, but their line is cursed to be damned to the Hells. What would happen in this instance? 
+_>' [@] Only priests, paladins, and fanatics are devoted to one deity in the Realms. Everyone believes in all deites, and worships (even if only lip-service, now and then) most of them. So if an individual is devoted to one deity, that deity would have the strongest claim on their soul.

+_>' [@] Stuffed toys and comfort cuddlers for adults exist in the Realms, but very seldom bears (and of course, not "Teddy Bears"=no Roosevelt). In everyday speech, they're "softfurries." and most are shaped like kittens or like Piglet from the Pooh tales (sewn in a gingerbread man pose)

+_>' [@] I'll share more Manshoon lore when I can. He's multifaceted. Both he and El do a lot of "the ends justify the means," but El has narrower "acceptable" means and plays a longer game/is more patient. (Khelben = VERY narrow set of acceptable means and was short on patience, too.)

I remember reading a while back (I think it was FR1?) a passage that described him as a “certain famous barbarian” and I figured he was supposed to be “Conan the Barbarian has retired as Duran the Bartender,” and played him that way. Future publications seemed to overlook that. He was never supposed to be Conan. He was supposed to be a smarter, more street-wise young adventurer with the thews and luck of Conan, but a good grounding in the ways of Waterdeep and "civilization." Practical, pragmatic. Which is why he retired the moment he'd made his bundle.

Y’all figure trans folks in Rashemen are treated by gender ID in terms of what paths they can take, or does it present uncomfortable choices and challenges for them? 
I figure the spirits would see them spiritually, not physically 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] I mean, you already have the answer from Ed (ultimately, the witches judge people spiritually and not strictly by their physical presentation, with some disagreement across generations), but I'll add the reminder that the Realms is generally a more tolerant place than our world. 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] There are obviously exceptions and there's plenty of confusion, but cis-heteronormativity isn't the standard, the way it is here. For most Realms people, once an identity is clear, they're happy to refer to it that way.
In the Realms, bigots are the weirdos, not the mainstream. 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] Great point! The thing I still wonder about is, how do the spirits view someone whose gender isn’t clearly binary? For a warrior, it’s easy, but for someone with the ability to sling spells and call spirits ? 
?_>' [@] [@] [@] Maybe the spirits basically tell the hathran what sort of person this individual is, and where they fit? Maybe there is a small space for such individuals that isn’t open to either strictly male or female rashemi? 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] Certainly. The hathran are primarily concerned with loyalty to the ideals of Rashemen as a society, and whether a given individual should be trained and accepted as a witch, or not. There's a place in society for almost everyone.

Yeah that’s him! I didn’t know his name and I was trying to look up pictures of him. For some reason I thought he had an enlarge spell cast on him or is he an actual giant? Does he have some kind of ring of enlargement that makes him Big like that? No magic, and not a giant (though he probably has giant blood way back in his family tree somewhere); he was just one of those guys who was born big, and grew. (There are 8-foot-tall real-life humans walking around the planet right now. .) 
+_>' [@] And there's at least one official TSR illustration of him, b&amp;w, with Piergeiron, I think it was in one of the booklets of the 2nd Edition CITY OF SPLENDORS boxed set, probably Who's Who In Waterdeep (though I'm away from my books right now).

?_>' [@] Good sir, somewhere I found that Silmerhelve family of Waterdeep was of Iluskan ethnicity in lat 1200s DR. Would you say that would change in late 1400s DR? 
+_>' [@] By the late 1400s DR the Silmerhelves have become so mixed by intermarriage with other Waterdhavians, noble and otherwise, that like most nobles of Waterdeep, they're more "Waterdhavian" than anything else. (Several Silmerhelves wed successful adventurers from afar.)
