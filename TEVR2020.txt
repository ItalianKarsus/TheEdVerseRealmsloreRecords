?_> [@] Ed! This may have been asked before, but I can't find the answer anywhere:
How do people in Forgotten Realms adress low-ranked clerics or wizard students? "His holiness" and "master" sound too big for someone who is killing rats in a tavern basement. 
+_> [@] Most folk address a cleric of uncertain (but likely low-ish) rank as "Devout" or "Avowed." For wizards, the default term is "Master of Art" or "Lord/Lady of Art" ("Master" is all-genders, but older folk might instead say "Lady Master of Art" and this wouldn't offend). 
+_> [@] And if you don't know for certain that you're addressing a cleric (no visible holy symbol or vestments), or an apprentice mage, "Learned Saer" or "Learned Lady" are always-safe, polite alternatives (i.e. universally seen across the Realms as trying to be polite).

Tue Sep 30 23:22:44 (Border Kingdoms, Cormaeril, Gulthmere, Realmslore, Sword Coast, Westgate)

?_> [@] do you have any more details on the Westgate noble families around 1371-1372 DR? The Bleths and Cormaerils are already pretty well-detailed, but I haven't found much to differentiate a lot of the others beyond their heads and house symbols. 
+_> 1)
Guldar
Patriarch: Lareskur Guldar, a haughty, hawk-nosed and flowing blond-haired man of cold looks, firm control of his voice and facial expression (a born actor) who likes to dominate any room, lording it over all others. The youngest of five brothers, it’s 
Realsmlore [:] 
+_> 2) widely (but incorrectly) rumored in Westgate that he covertly murdered his siblings to wind up the sole survivor and heir (the truth: two brothers murdered each other, a third was poisoned by a business partner he’d swindled, and disease killed the fourth). 
+_> 3)
Lareskur knows about his reputation and does nothing to quell the rumors, because he likes to be feared by the populace. The inheritor of great wealth, he does little to earn anything, devoting his time to playing at being an above-all-inferiors (which in his  
+_> 4) eyes, is everyone short of the gods and their archpriests) senior noble. He loves good food and drink, has a prodigious capacity for strong drink without succumbing to debilitating drunkenness, and likes to hunt.
Matriarch: Glazrathella Guldar, a former Urdo  
+_> 5) who is even more of a sneering snob than her husband. Her striking blonde beauty and statuesque height would make her even more remarkable if she didn’t wear a perpetual sneer, and spend so much time being icily dismissive. She often doesn’t speak or directly  
+_> 6) look at individuals she deems servants or “common.” In private, she’s a passionate hedonist who takes many lovers from among the household staff and other nobles at revels, not because she doesn’t love Lareskur, but because her appetites would need seven or  
+_> 7) eight Lareskurs to be satisfied. She eats very little, just takes “a taste” at every meal, and when not flirting or coupling, works in her studios (sculpting or working on cabinetry).
Heir: Harondro Guldar, a coarse-featured, raven-haired strongman who loves  
+_> 8) wrestling—and sculpting and carpentry. There’s nothing at all wrong with his brains, and he’s both cunning and very quick-witted, but he prefers to work with his hands to learning, reading, or paying any attention at all to matters of business, society, or  
+_> 9) culture. Revels bore him unless he can wench or wrestle or roughhouse, and he’s been known to start brawls for entertainment. He thinks the family wealth will take care of itself, and that he can’t possibly spend enough of it to wind up poor once he inherits 
+_> 10) so why concern himself with it at all? If anything angers him, he searches Westgate for a worthy foe to beat to a pulp (often in a dockers’ tavern) and cuts loose.
Notable Rakes/Adventurers: none still living
The House of the Black Hawk is known to be very  
+_> 11) rich, and to have a long heritage of equipping and sponsoring mercenary companies active in Chessenta, the Vilhon, Amn, and the Border Kingdoms. All of the current family also have personal sidelines in sculpting and in fine carpentry, with a reputation for  
+_> 12) building in artfully-concealed secret compartments, and selling their work via the most exclusive dealers to various Sword Coast nobles. House Guldar remains a major Westgate landlord, and owns a lot of farmland (worked by others) in Turmish 
+_> 13)
They claim a large expanse of the Gulthmere Forest as a private hunting preserve, though its exclusivity tends to be honored only in their presence.

Sun May 04 18:12:09 (Realmslore, Spellplague)

?_> [@] Hi, I've been looking for information about Hawkhill and the Baron's Blades band stationed there. Do the barony and band persist into the post-Second Sundering era? And who were the band's members? (I've only found out about Lashantar from her Thaldigar's Tower sheet) 
+_> 1)
Hawkhill is a remote barony in the northernmost foothills at the northeastern end of the Cloud Peaks that form the northern border of Amn. It consists mainly of dirt lanes and sheep farms: rolling pastures fenced with
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) gathered-together boulders-and-rubble fieldstone walls.

+_> 3) though he’s but a novice wizard; a widower, he dwells in a small keep, and has a tall, muscular paladin of a daughter) hired an adventuring band to be his personal bodyguard and enforcers: the dozen-strong Baron’s Blades. 
+_> 4)
These are 2e D&D characters I used in playtests for TSR from 1993 to 1997 (and in many GenCon charity events and other convention Realmsplay sessions, down the years), and consist of: 
+_> 5)
Bralagar CN hm P7 of Tempus
Lashantar CG hf P7 of Tymora
Tashram CG hm P7 of Tymora
Elthreene CG hf W8
Maskar CG hm W8
Zhond NG hm W4
Brella Ilfrost NG hf F8
Chandlara Flamestar CG hf F9
Thorm Dunsheld NG hm F9 
+_> 6)
Delthrar Dawnstorm NG hm R9
Ildrem Thaln CN hm T9 and
Symbril Cragar CN hf T10 (For more recent adopters of D&D, a “Rogue” was once a “Thief” and that’s what the Ts are.) 
+_> 7)
And they (and the Baron, his daughter, and all the folk of his keep) survived the Spellplague and the Sundering, and are still alive today, thanks to a Phezult's Sleep of Ages trap accidentally triggered by the Blades ("treasure" they brought back to the keep).

Local subsistence farming goes on everywhere in the Realms, as everyone has to eat. Most folk grow up knowing the wilderness, with monsters roaming it, is all around them, and that and farming and gleaning wild foodstuffs is just daily life. Roads and merchant

Sure. This topic comes up here at Twitter every year or so, and I’ve answered it many times, so please be aware that I’m generalizing here.
Netherese rarely use surnames. Except for noble or ruling families (like the Tanthuls

Arimmon, Glest, Heirakaunt, Larezmiir, Maeraklaervel, Norlyal, Orivven, Yadanth

Given names often use double-a constructions, end in ‘ol’ more than the namings of other times and cultures, often begin with M, and often include ‘oun’ or ‘aun

Male examples: Aglaren, Bezoarn, Clarbrennus, Dyrar, Eirol, Ethuud (pronounced “Eth-OOD”), Lamorund, Malant, Mlaarol, Naraeyn, Orthol, Rivalagorn, Skord, Tabrakh, Vaereth, Yulvaun.

Fri Oct 03 04:16:55 (Cormyr, Realmslore)

+_> Jeremy E. Grenemyer the bastard son of Stonekettle [@] morning [@] 
Are there any types of mushrooms the villagers of Blustich harvest from the edges of The Hermit’s Wood around the start of Winter in Cormyr?
Thank you, Ed, as always. 
+_> 1)
Took me a long time to find my notes on these; sorry for the delay. Take heart, all questioners who’ve been waiting a long time for a lore reply; I hang on to all questions, and answer all I can, no matter how long it takes! 
+_> 2)
These villagers harvest three edible sorts of mushrooms; luckily, they are easily distinguished from locally-growing poisonous fungi. I’ve listed them in descending order of abundance. They are all very rare elsewhere. 
+_> 3)
Uttercaps (“fairy clusters”), which are small clusters of 5-8 nut-brown mushroom caps about the size of the end-joint of an adult human thumb, all growing on very dark brown (almost black), slender stems about as long as an 
+_> 4) adult human hand. These taste like roasted almonds, and can be eaten raw or fried in butter or boar fat. Some folk add them to brandy, which they ‘taint’ into a nutty, buttery, almost cinammony taste. Children of Blustich 
+_> 5) habitually eat these as snacks when playing outdoors.
Khondyn (“mushroom pies”) are dun-brown, flat-topped circular mushrooms that look like perfectly horizontal plates, set on stalks. As they pass pleasant edibility 
+_> 6) they turn dark brown, then black and glistening as they rot (still edible, without harm, but no longer pleasant to the taste). A Khondyn, unlike most mushrooms, is a full meal for an adult; very filling, and with a taste very 
+_> 7) like breaded chicken. Can be eaten raw, or fried (sharpens the taste into a “sharp cheddar cheese”-like quality), or baked atop bread or flatbread dough to give it a cheesy taste.
Thoud (pronounced “thood”) are rare 
+_> 8) unpleasant-looking fungi spikes that look like gray-white shucked corncobs growing vertically up from the ground (their tough, strong stalks are so short that the rest of the mushroom hides them from all eyes that aren’t 
+_> 9) right at ground level, but are as strong as, and look a bit like, the stalk a pumpkin grows on). Their looking-like-corn-kernels tiny outer-surface pustules are spore-sacs, not kernels that can break off; these eventually 
+_> 10) dry out, rupture, and release smoke-like threads of fine, dust-like gray-black spores for the wind to spread. Raw thoud have the consistency of raw potato, but baked thoud turn fluffy; raw or cooked are equally edible, and 
+_> 11) share a “buttered popcorn with dill or garlic or chives dressing” taste. The taste varies in herb-like quality depending on their soil (sandier is closer to dill, rich soil is most like garlic, in between is like chives).

?_> Hi, [@] . How you been? Hope you're well.
I was wondering which arcane institution resides in Neverwinter in the 1490s. The NCS states that the Many-Starred disappeared during the Spellplague, so perhaps Neverember brought a new magical order with him? 1/2

Sun Oct 05 04:59:56 (Realmslore, Silverymoon, Waterdeep)

+_> Anton [@] in Sardolphyn’s Gambit you mentioned other families of Waterdeep: Eskult, Yeldred and Tramnur. Can you please tell about them more? 
+_> 1) [Last family!]
The Yeldred family of North Ward is perhaps the most interesting of the three “wannabe noble” families. They became fabulously wealthy over the past century by controlling quarries where flagstones, cobbles, and roof-slates 
+_> 2) were produced that much of Waterdeep is now (after rebuilding and renovations and the ongoing maintenance of the last six decades) built of, and by owning a shipping fleet and three caravan companies active in the Heartlands 
+_> 3) (mainly on short, fast, lucrative Amn/Baldur’s Gate/Waterdeep/Silverymoon runs), and by shrewd investments in various guilds, shops, and forges.
So the Yeldreds alive today have always known more coin than they know how to 
+_> 4) spend. What it won’t buy them is a noble title, and some of them very much want it. They tried “nobility on the cheap,” which meant settling their own wilderlands north of the eastern Amnian mountain barony of Hawkhill 
+_> 5) calling it the “realm” of Vaeranth (Vaeranth Yeldred was the founder of this scheme), and styling themselves Lords and Ladies of Vaeranth, complete with elaborate blazons, but no one in Waterdeep would recognize or use the 
+_> 6) titles, no matter how many ornate maps of Vaeranth the Yeldreds hired cartographers to produce and distribute throughout the city. Vaeranth remains a wilderness today, albeit with three small stone keeps the Yeldreds built 
+_> 7) they retain one by paying a garrison to dwell there that they must supply with food and chapbooks and strong drink and paid companions, and the other two were seized by brigands who from time to time are wiped out by monsters 
+_> 8) deciding to lair therein, until the next brigands come along and slay the beasts.
So now, the Yeldreds are trying to marry into nobility.
As of the 1490s DR, the Yeldreds consist of one boy (Paerand, who’s 9 years old), and 
+_> 9) six women: Paerand’s mother Esmarheldra, the matriarch (there is no family patriarch, as her husband Boldrael died 8 years ago), and her five daughters, who in descending order of age are Astrauva (21 years old), Vauntra 
+_> 10) (20), Jaerezra (19), Palone (18), and Sapraenra (17). All are good-looking, graceful, and polite, and Esmarheldra, Astrauva, Vauntra, and Palone are stunningly beautiful and superb natural actors (in complete control of 
+_> 11) their voices, facial expressions, and mannerisms, and able to weep at will). For the last four summers, they have deliberately set about getting invited to nobles’ revels, at first as arm candy for other non-noble guests 
+_> 12) but they have slowly and deftly cultivated friendships with nobles of higher and higher rank, trying to build networks of eligible batchelor nobles they fancy, with an eye to marrying into the ranks of the nobility. 
+_> 13)
They don’t want to be saddled with dullards or brutes or insane/headstrong narcissists, and so are seeking to learn all they can about their quarries without being obvious about their prying or seeming to be pursuing mates 
+_> 14) but nobles aren’t unperceptive when it comes to suitors, and have caught on. The fact that these oh-so-charming females are all from one family hasn’t gone unnoticed, and various covert tricks and hired spellcastings have 
+_> 15) been employed to try to make sure the Yeldred women are indeed human, and not doppelgangers or other shapeshifters, and self-willed rather than the thralls of illithids or anyone/anything else. Various nobles privately (but 
+_> 16) erroneously) suspect the Yeldreds of being sorceresses, members of a cult, and agents of various cabals and sinister organizations.
Thus far, the dance of flirtation and slow, subtle courtship hasn’t resulted in any Yeldred 
+_> 17) getting hitched, or even serious interest, but the daughters are all firm friends—and, gossip insists, sometime lovers—of a dozen nobles (of both genders, and a variety of families) each. 
+_> 18)
Paerand is a quiet, happy-with-his-own-company boy who reads voraciously, plays board games against any handy opponent, and although he's far from feminine, loves women's clothing and prefers to wear his elder sisters' castoffs. His hobby? Sponsoring adventurers.

+_> 6) to cater to the character class mix of the PCs, for one thing. .but not DOZENS of empty rooms. All of that hit the cutting room floor.
The hidden portal isn’t on the published version of the Haunted Halls map. See the natural 
+_> 7) rock rift that has “26” in/above it? It’s supposed to have areas that soar up above the main dungeon level, up to the (map missing) upper citadel (now used by the kobolds as a lair). The kobolds defecate down this rift 
+_> 8) using it as a gigantic latrine. Down in its bottom were originally not just piles of reeking kobold dung (and an otyugh, of course), but eerie glows that respond to spells cast down at them. One of them actually outlines an 
+_> 9) invisible “standing in midair” door. .a dead giveaway that there’s a gate/portal there. (I’m not saying where it leads to; I put several gates in the module, so players could take their characters to adventure in farflung 
+_> 10) locations all over the Realms. .and of COURSE they all got taken out, because TSR wanted to publish a module, not a linked series of rising-in-character-level “sandboxes.”)
Yes, the zapping statues need to be circumvented, not 
+_> 11) destroyed or ‘beaten,’ but the way around them got edited out of the published module, too.
You’re right, Whisper’s Crypt was far off the map to the north, along a long, long straight corridor. Reached from the (edited out of 
+_> 12) the module) lower level that had a few rooms with formidable monsters (PCs were supposed to level up dealing with things on “the ground floor” AND the kobolds, ere they dared to go down), one of them with a simple but nasty 
+_> 13) trap: huge (as in, 40 feet tall), impressive bronze double doors that weren’t attached to anything, so trying to pull one open would bring it crashing down to crush anyone within 40 feet of it. So, yes, mean DM, as labelled. 
+_> 14)
Though there was ample room to just stand to one side and avoid the doors, and a floor design intended to tell the DM where PCs were standing without alerting the players to the fact that where their characters was standing 
+_> 15) was important.
And George is right: it was the Sword Heralds. All of the edited-out stuff, including what’s going on down there, was duly delivered to TSR in my turnover, and I was paid for it at the time, so it’s NDA and TSR 
+_> 16) (now WotC) owns it, so unless they release me from the NDA, I can’t share, beyond brief casual summaries. The Mages Regal WERE a thing, ALSO NDA, but not in the Haunted Halls. They represent yet another loose end that never 
+_> 17) got followed up on. Building in new loose ends was a design principle of the Realms, but when TSR did it in-house, they had a distressing tendency to change direction and leave their shiny new loose ends hanging. Forever.

+_> 1)
So many variables would affect takings, but the 1330s DR are boom times, both before and after the Spellplague hits (in the wake of its initial chaos, inns/taverns became refuges for many, who craved good food, good company

Vhammos
Patriarch: Jaraedren (“Jar-RAY-drenn”) Vhammos, a balding, aging but still-vigorous man who is one of the slow-to-decide-anything ditherers of life, a man of few and guarded words, no hobbies, and not much thought. He eats the same things most evenings

Matriarch: Brezmra Vhammos, a fiery-tempered, long flame-orange-haired buxom beauty who has flashing

Heiress: Paerendra (“Pair-ENN-drah”) Vhammos is a vivacious, bored, beautiful young woman desperate to escape the prison of being a pampered noble and see the wider world and have adventures in it. She knows she’s very fortunate to never want for warmth in

Notable Rakes/Adventurers: none living
Formerly notorious as a crooked noble house, adroit at swindling—and at poisonings, when caught—House Vhammos long ago

And there you have it, brief glimpses of the senior noble houses of Westgate, back in the day. Enjoy, I hope!

No
Milk and beer are transported by the cask (big) or keg (the "barrel" you're used to) or handkeg (small, rope handles both ends or in a net around it, for easy handling), and only poured out of these into flasks for serving. Some large city establishments

Which doesn't mean your characters couldn't start a fad of assembling and selling packs which just might catch on!

Mon May 26 01:43:48 (Jergal, Moander, Realms deities, Realmslore, Toril, the Realms, the Weave)

+_> Michael [@] Okay. So I feel that it's a reasonable assumption that within a pantheon there may be, at most, one deity that is the most powerful, who acts as a balancing force for the others, to maintain the status quo. (Io for the draconic pantheon 
+_> for e.g.)
But! For all the other gods, what is it that limits their ability to affect the lives of mortals and the mortal world? What is it that limits their interactions with other deities? 
Either gods are infinite or finite and if finite, what are their limits? 
+_> 1)
I’ve created upwards of forty fantasy settings (as opposed to sf, alternate real-world, and so on) over the years, with very different pantheons, but in the Realms, Ao is the Overgod (setting limits and rules “above” the 
+_> 2) pantheon), and within the pantheon, the most powerful deity is Mystra, as Toril is a magic-rich world and she IS the Weave, and until Ao forbade her and stopped her, used her ability to cut other deities off from the Weave 
+_> 3) (that is, the ability to work magic).
So in the Realms, the gods are fallible (like the classic Greek and Roman gods, they have the same faults and flaws as many humans, though they have what to a mortal are “superpowers”) 
+_> 4)
No deity is infinite, in the Realms or elsewhere, if there’s a pantheon” the existence of other deities by definition means that any one deity has limits. The Realms deities can perish or be slain (Mystra more than once 
+_> 5)
Moander, and many others), can renounce their godhood or their portfolios (Jergal), go insane (Cyric), and often make mistakes or are deceived (even by mortals).
They are limited by their own brains (what they can conceive 
+_> 6) and create), their own powers (perception and abilities), by other gods acting against them, by their very natures, by Ao, and by the structure of Toril and of the Planes of Existence. The gods are constantly warring with 
+_> 7) each other for more power and influence, so at every turn one deity or another will run up against resistance. And some deities (Jergal, for instance) are VERY good at manipulating other deities.

A scramble-squirrel is a small, furry rodent that scurries and scrambles about in small packs or family groups of a dozen or a dozen-and-a-half strong; in behavior, curiosity, boldness, and persistence it’s akin to a

They have very sharp seven-toed claws and a great sense of balance, and typically race along high tree

Scramble-squirrels are prey for many things, and throughout the 1300s and 1400s DR have been growing less and less common across the woodlands of

Faerûn. They are edible, and quite tasty roasted over an open fire, as they eat berries and green growing shoots and nuts and leaves when not able to pilfer meat, cheese, and bread from sentient wayfarers. 
+_> 9)
It’s not unusual in a wooded area, or farmland/ranchland with woodlots and hedge-lines of trees, to look out of a window and see a scramble-squirrel clinging to a precarious perch looking in at you (likely seeing if there’s a 
+_> 10) way in, and any food to be easily had, by the ‘snatch and race away again’ method).
Rathan of the Knights of Myth Drannor once described them as “Infuriatingly persistent little furballs,” but is known to have evened the odds 
+_> 11) on one occasion with an accurately-hurled mace, that stunned four scramble-squirrels and knocked them off a tree-limb; he promptly pounced, wrung their necks, and popped them in a stewpot. When he and Torm were eating the 
+_> 12) results, they had to guard their meal against other scramble-squirrels, who seemed eager to eat their boiled and seasoned fellows.
There’s just one known instance of scramble-squirrels being found in a city: the halfling 
+_> 13) thief Baerandle Borthcrown had a small family of trained scramblers he worked with, in Athkatla in the 1340s to 1380s DR; they stole small, valuable items like gems and jewelry via open upper windows for him, and 
+_> 14) he fed them well as a reward.
Oh, and they do make huffing and hissing noises, and snorts (but not loudly).

?_> [@] Hi Ed, how are you? Can you help me with your vast knowledge? I would like to know more details about the elements that appear in this symbol. Can you help me ? [:] 
+_> weary lit prof [@] [@] 
I was wondering if you could answer a #dnd question. Does the symbol on the cover of the 3rd ed. Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting book mean anything? I've long wondered. [:] 
+_> 1)
There’s a lot to unpack in that cover sigil, and believe it or not, there are still NDAs relating to some meanings (what I can say is that one of the messages is akin to “Behold and enjoy your Realms”). So let’s look at that 
+_> 2) writing, and we can readily see that it’s a ring of Dethek runes with a ring of Espruar script around it. The Dethek runes read: “The secret fires of our hearts burn with the memory of wars lost and heroes slain, but like the 
+_> 3) stone from which we came, we endure” and is an age-old saying of the dwarves. The Espruar runes read “We remember cities now in ruin and forests murdered, yet still we sing to the stars and hope for renewal,” and is an elven 
+_> 4) saying during the time of the Retreat (“cities” being spelt “sities” as there’s no “C” in Espruar).
These rings of script encircle a central symbol of three linked rings that denote the Multiverse or the Cosmic All or Ao 
+_> 5) depending on your tradition (who in the Realms taught you what those rings stand for). The three diamonds are from the sagecraft, and denote the Realms Below (the Underdark), the Realms Above (the surface world), and the 
+_> 6)
Starry Void (Realmspace, or what we might call the heavens, or the Outer Planes of Existence, again depending on your tradition).
You’ll see a “bump” between the 7-o’clock and 8-o’clock position on the innermost ring around 
+_> 7)
Ao, that’s a crescent moon with a dot ‘above’ the crescent/between its horns. This is, of course, the symbol of Elminster, and it’s there because he is, however unreliably, our main source of information about the Realms. 
+_> 8)
There’s another symbol that stands out as immediately recognizable, between the 4-o’clock and 5-o’clock position, jutting out of the outermost ring. It’s the symbol of Mystra, and she’s there as “the” deity of the Realms, for 
+_> 9) she is the Weave that almost all beings use to source magic.
The sword symbol at the 9-o’clock position of the outer ring is the Sword of Tyr, but is also there to represent Tempus, and war.
The symbol at the 10-o’clock 
+_> 10) position similarly stands for multiple deities and concepts, one of them being Lolth (her web); I can’t find my old notes on this at the moment (they’re likely in a box out in the larger shipping container, so expect more

Oh, yes. There are four really famous human operas that get performed many times and in many places across Faerûn, every year: The Lovelorn Knight, Alvaericknar, The War Of Three Castles, and Downdragon Harr.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
The Lovelorn Knight:
A knight falls in love with haughty woman after haughty woman who doesn’t love him. Sad and despondent, he is heartbroken when he discovers THE woman, only to discover she prefers the company of women, so

+_> 5)
Alvaericknar:
The merry misadventures of a rascal who outwits foe after foe, swindling them in the process, until he robs a lich who slays Alvaericknar. But the merry rogue has played a trick, and arranged that his horrible 
+_> 6) demise takes place in a spot of active enchantments, so he’s magically forced into undeath. As an undead, he goes right on being a swindling, fun-loving rascal, only now he doesn’t need food or drink or shelter. 
+_> 7)
He still likes wine and the ladies, though. 
+_> 8)
The War Of Three Castles:
THE opera for those who love heavy, martial marches and triumphant horncalls and heroic deaths in battle, this saga concerns three warring kingdoms whose kings hate each other, and each decide to 
+_> 9) obliterate their rivals and conquer their realms, no matter what the cost. Each hurls his warrior princes and princesses into battle, at the heads of the realms’ armies, and of course they fight each other, wound each other 
+_> 10) plunge into the Underdark when the ground beneath them collapses, and there, amid the tombs of long-dead kings, they nurse each other back to health and fall in love with each other in so doing: two princes and one 
+_> 11) princess, who can’t choose between the princes but is adamant that she shall have them both, equally, or neither. She prevails, and they decide to wed each other in a three-crowns union, even if their fathers execute them 
+_> 12) for it. Yet when they struggle back to the surface, fighting loathly worms to do so, they discover all three kings dead, the kingdoms laid waste by marauding monsters after their armies had annihilated each other, and the 
+_> 13) few surviving peasants only too happy to have peace—in a new, united, three-crowns realm (where everyone seems to sing in melodious chorus).

?_> [@] Dear Ed, are there tacos in Faerun, or something like them at least? If so, where would someone find them and what culture would they be in? Asking for my taco loving players. 
+_> 1)
Taco” is not a name known on Toril, but fried hardcrust roundbreads (what some real-worlders might call pitas, but fried crispy-hard) that have been stuffed with a hot cooked mix of minced-meat, spices
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) vegetables (diced and fried onions and/or potatoes, and/or Brussels sprouts, and/or asparagus, and/or leeks, and/or artichoke hearts, and/or radishes, and/or mushrooms) and sauces ARE known and devoured eagerly in many 
+_> 3) eateries, especially in the Vilhon, the lands south of there to the Shaar and beyond (so, places like Innarlith and south to include Luiren and Var the Golden), and are slowly spreading along the trade routes in all 
+_> 4) directions, to Chessenta and eastern Tethyr and Amn, to Calimshan and the Lake of Steam cities, and to Scornubel. You can even order them in some inns and taverns (yes, they’re becoming “the new thing” in tavern fare) in 
+_> 5)
Secomber.
The meat tends to be whatever’s plentiful and cheap locally, from lamb to rabbit and all manner of small scurrying things, from “tree-cats” [squirrels] to rats, and the flavor profile varies from merely savory to 
+_> 6) hot-spiced; most establishments will ask “hot” or “warming” (= fiery or mild) when you order.
So, a folded-over, exposed-spilling-edge taco is a rare thing indeed, and cheese-drenched tacos are a special variant version 
+_> 7) anywhere they can be had, but the same sort of ingredients in essentially the same combination (so, a flat, closed taco, which varies from a “handpie” in that it was never full of gravy, and its outer pastry is thin and fried 
+_> 8) crispy-hard) can now be had in many places.
What it’s called varies from place to place; along the Sword Coast it tends to be called a “fryhard,” in the Vilhon, a “crunchtart,” in the South, a “hotbite,” and along the 
+_> 9) trade-routes, any of these three or even something else.
Elminster and the Seven all like “handfry pies” made with six or seven sorts of mushrooms, parsnips, leeks or spring onions (all diced), and strong cheeses (no meat). 
+_> 10)
The shell of a Torilian taco, whatever it’s called, is often rather like cornbread in its composition. Or a crisp naan (and is sometimes made by “gluing” two round-tortilla-like discs together with cheese).

The Illances have been around for a long, long time, and have used various blazons, down the years, but for the last two centuries have used a black raven, clutching a black lance, on a crimson (blood-red) field. The raven is

?_> [@] does Loudwater, circa 1300s DR have a coat of arms? If so, can you describe it please. Thanks. 
+_> 1)
It does: a “pale” (vertical stripe down the center of the heraldic heater-shaped shield) of deep blue, representing the River Delimbiyr. On either side of this, the shield is gold (representing the grain-verdant farms on both
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) banks of the river). In the “chief” position (a vertical bar crossing the top of the shield, overlapping the pale) is a steel-gray bar, representing the bridge that crosses the Delimbiyr at Loudwater. (The blazon predates 
+_> 3) the growth of Loudwater to the confluence of the Greyflow and Delimbiyr rivers, so the Greyflow doesn’t appear in Loudwater’s arms at all.)
In the gold field on either side of the pale (dexter and sinister positions in the 
+_> 4) fess, “floating” in from the edge of the shield), are two identical steel-gray gauntlets, palms toward the viewer of the shield but clenched into fists, a left-hand gauntlet on the left and a right-hand gauntlet on the right

These represent both the Gauntlets of Loudwater, who police and guard the settlement and its surrounding farms, and the protection/“civilization” they provide.

Sun Mar 16 04:10:45 (Realmslore, Sword Coast, the Realms)

?_> [@] hi Ed!
I'm wondering what naming conventions goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use? Goblins most importantly. Can you provide me any insight and example names please? 
+_> 1)
Different tribes and communities of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears vary widely in how they choose names and what they use in daily life. (A lesser-known feature of all three races, in the Realms, is that their societies are
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) essentially matriarchal. War chiefs may be large males, but female elders decide things, and lineage is traced through the females.) Atop that, some tribes place great importance on lineage and therefore clan membership and 
+_> 3) therefore use of surnames—and others don’t.
Which is a long-winded way of saying names vary from place to place in the Realms, among the same race. 
+_> 4)
However, MOST goblins an adventurer may encounter will have short, one-syllable first names, followed by a middle name that’s a family surname, and a surname that’s a clan name, like this: Darg Huum Sarsar. 
+_> 5) (In daily life, only the first names are used, as goblins work and go on war and foraging forays in family or clan groups; everyone knows everyone else, so therefore knows the bloodlines, so only given names are used.) 
+_> 6)
Hobgoblins tend to drop the clan name, and may have longer names.
Both races tend to have ‘proper names’ for their clans, that they use among themselves, rather than the versions they offer humans (Broken Fang, Tuskjaw, and so 
+_> 7) on), that emphasize fierce agression and brutish simplicity (the image they want to project to humans, to sew fear and encourage retreat and avoidance).
Bugbears may live in their own tribes, especially in the remote 
+_> 8)
Sword Coast North, but are more often loners, or live in pairs and trios, and may adventure with hobgoblins; in any case, they tend to have little use for surnames or even tribal names. 
+_> 9)
So here are some typical goblin female given names:
Arryka, Bela, Carra, Duika, Flarra, Guldra, Hornra, Jarakra, Klorra, Maara, Nurra, Oloa, Pulgra, Qlara, Ruusra, Surra 
+_> 10)
And here are some typical goblin male given names:
Buirak, Claeth, Darg, Flark, Goruk, Gurk, Hurk, Ithyk, Juk, Lurg, Morlg, Nurruk, Surk, Thulk, Ulgut, Varruk 
+_> 11)
Here are some typical hobgoblin female given names: Aiijra, Brukarra, Durrarra, Falora, Galrakka, Horlgurla, Ieirysk, Jlakka, Kalathka, Moragh, Nurkarra, Orlurkra, Peirkeir, Rakra, Tsarakra, Vururka 
+_> 12)
Here are some typical hobgoblin male given names: Burruk, Dulluk, Helgrak, Karrag, Luug, Murakh, Orruk, Rurkurl, Skult, Sorrakh, Turrusk (“Tusk”), Urgram, Vorog/Vorogh, Vulk, Yuthuk, Zuruk 
+_> 13)
Here are some typical bugbear female given names: Arrelkra, Coruzkra, Draylkuu, Eirendruu, Felrulkra, Gouruskk, Halavrakra, Jussurra, Kelvurra, Mauroekuu, Narlgramra, Orolkuu, Paerykk, Qulruu, Rulstra, Surulka 
+_> 14)
And finally, here are some typical bugbear male given names: Bulruglak, Calaglorm (“Calag”), Elgkryn, Forogg, Gorunkh, Gurrek, Hurrvulkh, Karlrankh, Korrak, Kulgor, Irunn, Jorrk, Orulk, Rulktur (“Rulk”), Sagrakh, Yurturlg

?_> All the adventures were written by [@] . Ed, can you provide any memories or anecdotes about writing this boxed set? [:] 
+_> 1)
Sure. The encounter areas really only drew on Level 1 of Undermountain (not its top level, as it had 2 of those, one the thieves' citadel inside Mount Waterdeep {see Room 23} and the Fireplace Dungeon), and to swiftly get the set out, TSR drew on an existing 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Dave Sutherland Empire of the Petal Throne dungeon map; that's where most of the gigantic rooms came from.
At the same time, I was writing all of those mini-adventures in one week (around my library day job and its 100-mile-each-way daily commute). :}

The "home" Realms campaign was and is all intrigue and PCs have 'day jobs' as well as adventuring, and developing relationships with NPC neighbours, so Undermountain was crammed with burnt-out torches and other remnants of previous adventurers, as well as

The thing about half-folk is that they VARY; not all offspring of even the same two parents (of different races) will look the same, and there's even more "variety" of appearance when it comes to different parents. This drow mother/human father-child can look 
Realmslore [:]

However, if I was the storyteller (or DM, creating an NPC), I would have a tiefling tail and likely horns or at least "brow-bumps," drow ears and fine-boned features and general body build and skin hue would vary widely from individual to individual. But YMMV.

Weave anchors became a thing back in 2012 when Wizards cooked up the idea of the Spellplague and time-jump (4e), and I had to explain why ALL magic didn’t collapse AND keep certain characters alive for the planned Sundering
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) series. Already in Realmslore, from 1986, to explain why Mystra wasn’t THE goddess, ruling all other deities in such a magic-rich world, was the concept of Mystra being forced (by an Overgod who turned out to be Ao) to

After Mystra banned the usage of above 9th level spells and re-coded the weave how did the shadow weave respond to that change? Can someone still cast above 9th level spells using shadow weave since Shar is the one who regulates it?

The Shadow Weave is an "echo" of the Weave; it clings to, feeds off of, and is supported by the Weave. All limitations on the Weave also apply to the Shadow Weave, except this: chaos effects are often augmented.

Sun Mar 09 16:41:03 (Abeir, Forgotten Realms, Realmslore, Realmspace, Toril, the Weave)

?_> [@] [@] 
Is Mystra the goddess of the Weave of the whole multiverse，or she is just the Weavemaster of Toril?The phb says“The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra 
?_> [@] [@] 
Can I understand it as:There is only one Weave in the multiverse,and wizards of the Toril named the only Weave Mystra?Or it is:The different worlds have different Weavemasters,and they rule the Weave of their own worlds? 
+_> 1)
I'd put it another way:
Toril and all other worlds have multiple ways of accessing the energies of each world. And usually call the non-mechanical, non-engineering ways of accessing those energies "magic
ONE of the ways on Toril is arcane magic (in D&D, wizard 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) and sorcerer spells), and those who have the Gift (ability to wield arcane magic, which they call the Art) or study arcane magic (sages) refer to their way of accessing the energies as "the Weave." The Weave IS Mystra, the goddess of magic, and the Weave only  
+_> 3) extends throughout Realmspace (Toril and moons and the void/heavens around them). Other worlds have other ways of accessing energies, and may have their own equivalents of the Weave (not identical, and not governed by Mystra) or may not. Abeir likely has an  
+_> 4) equivalent, because it's the sister world of Toril, so similar and even sometimes (the Sunderings) contiguous with Toril, so that elements of the two worlds get swapped, but Weave-based spells don't work on Abeir; but innate spellcasting abilities do. I.e. the 
+_> 5) world energies are similar enough that magical effects can be near-duplicated, but not how they're brought about.
So in theory, a powerful archwizard from Toril would have to start all over learning how to work magic on Abeir, and if no developed system of  
+_> 6) working arcane magic, they may never hit upon how to create magical effects on Abeir, or may spend the rest of their lives experimenting and making very little headway.
In theory, all worlds MIGHT have their own Weaves (under various names) and their own gods  
+_> 7) of magic, or not. "Weavemasters" is a term I coined back in the 1990s for anyone who'd mastered the Weave (understanding its workings enough to not need the trappings of arcane magic like material, somatic, and verbal components), so they could work magic by  
+_> 8) silent act of will, rather than conventional casting. Accomplished, experienced Weavemasters (like most of the Chosen of Mystra) can think of what they want to do, then mentally call on the Weave to do it. So they can work magic when tied up, gagged, and so  
+_> 9) on, when traditional casters would be rendered helpless. They control the Weave only so much as they call upon it, and so are not the same as a deity of magic who is the Weave (e.g. Mystra) or who governs the Weave.
So Mystra IS the Weave within Realmspace  
+_> 10) only, and is greater than a Weavemaster. Other worlds have other systems of magic, and even Toril has other systems of magic (divine magic, for example). Most other systems of magic use the Weave for convenience, but need not do so (travel from real-world  
+_> 11) place to real-world place is easier using the existing road system, but could be accomplished, in many cases, by not using the existing road system).

?_> Hi [@] I was wondering if the Sharn Wall is intact again following the Second Sundering? Thx! (art used with permission of WOTC) [:] 
+_> 1)
One of the most important secret missions undertaken by the Chosen of Mystra in the immediate wake of the crash of the city of Thultanthar onto Myth Drannor (1487 DR; seen in THE HERALD) was to mend the breach in the Sharn Wall.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
That hole, torn in 1371 DR (see the Return of the Archwizards trilogy), allowed large numbers of phaerimm to escape confinement, but nigh all of them were destroyed in fighting that followed (as described in that trilogy) 
+_> 3)
Many phaerimm that didn’t manage to break free then were ravaged by a mighty magic worked by the Srinshee, and later renewed by several of the Seven Sisters, that used the material of the Sharn Wall immediately around the 
+_> 4) breach like a webwork of multiple forceblades to slice through creatures attempting to navigate the breach in the Wall.
All of the Chosen involved in mending the Wall sacrificed some of Mystra’s essence within themselves 
+_> 5) (lessening their personal power) to swiftly expand the Wall across the breach and meld it seamlessly together; the mending was successful.
However, how many phaerimm are still trapped under Anauroch, within their ancient 
+_> 6) prison—and how many are free and lurking on Toril (or Abeir, having moved from Toril during the Sundering)—is unknown. “Not many,” Elminster told me, but he said it rather grimly.
The phaerimm trapped in the Memory Spire are 
+_> 7) awake and able to cast their life-draining magics (and increasingly, other spells), but aren’t free. Rather, they are watched over by Weaveghosts loyal to Mystra, who can call on the Weave to blunt and deflect the phaerimm 
+_> 8) magics and foil any attempts on their part to break free. (Abeir, Anauroch, Myth Drannor, Realmslore, Srinshee, The Herald, Thultanthar, Toril, the Weave)

Most “just plain folks” in the Realms have never seen a satyr, and hear of them only in tavern tales that play up their trickster, dangerous denizen of the woodlands, horny reputations. But an adventurer who played pipes

The general reputation of satyrs is that they’re glib, charismatic, randy thieves who’ll have sex with anyone (all genders and ages) given the slightest encouragement

Mon Dec 01 03:00:41 (Castle Ward, Mirt, NDA, Realmslore, Undermountain, Yawning Portal)

?_> Hi [@] what does the Yawning Portal look like from the outside? 
+_> 1)
Right, here we go
The Yawning Portal fronts on Rainrun Street in Castle Ward, and rises from its cobbles four floors (ground floor, and three above). It’s been rebuilt several times after various fires and adventurer-caused
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) damage, gaining a new uppermost floor in the process, and is now (1490s DR) all of mismatched, gorgon-mortared (so no teleportation through the walls) gray (unpainted) fieldstone, with three-foot-thick walls, and a 
+_> 3) steeply-pitched slate (dark gray to black, unpainted) roof. The ground floor has no windows, just wide but single-swing doors on the E and W sides of the central southface “bumpout” (a forty-foot-long section projects about 
+_> 4) ten feet south out into Rainrun Street, and has doors at both ends, opening into a vestibule with bootjacks, a cloak and coat-hanging rack along the inside S wall, and a reception desk with a hostess and three “housejacks 
+_> 5) (bouncers) behind it along its N side, with an opening to pass on into, or out of, the main inn at the E end of this desk.
The shape of the building can most clearly and accurately be seen on the 2e CITY OF SPLENDORS boxed set 
+_> 6) map (it’s Castle Ward feature 48, near the top edge of the southernmost page of the big foldout map): looked down on from above, it’s roughly a rectangle with the long axis E-W, an E wall that’s diagonal SE to NW, and a 
+_> 7) slightly slanted (to the NW) W wall. The S wall is thirty-five feet long from its western corner to the 40-foot-long central bumpout, then runs on E for another 40 feet past the bumpout to its other end.
The N wall has a 
+_> 8) thirty-foot (measuring west to east) W end, then jogs slightly E of due S, S about 15 feet to the back door/deliveries door/kitchen door of the inn, which is double-width and barred (it can be unbarred, opened up, and the 
+_> 9) bolts that anchor it down into the cibbles and up into its upper frame shot back, to fling it open wide enough for a low wagon or a full-width cart to be pushed in or pulled out, for kitchen and pantries and furniture 
+_> 10) access, though this is very rarely done).
This door access part of the N wall is sixteen feet wide, E-W, then runs due N twelve feet or so, to turn E and form the longest run of the inn’s N wall.
There are no windows at all on 
+_> 11) the ground/street floor, but heavy-wood-shutter-protected (and almost always closed) windows on the S wall of the floor above, on either side of the central bumpout.
On the floor above that are smaller, also 
+_> 12) wooden-shuttered, windows all along the S wall, at the S end of the W wall (looking down into the alleyway), and in the center of that long easternmost run of the N wall (looking down into the interior of the city block 
+_> 13) behind the inn).
On both floors above that, and the attic, are small windows looking due E, in the southern end of the E wall, looking out over the roof of the inn stables (which is the long, slender building adjoining the 
+_> 14)
Yawning Portal, butting onto its E wall and running E along Rainrun Street to touch Lankathla’s Bakery, the shop on the corner, which is only two floors tall, the uppermost being where Lantkathla Dree and her all-female 
+_> 15) [two wives and four daughters] live, above their baking floor).
The inn has two stone chimneys rising up past its roofpeak ridge, out of both angles where its walls head N on either side of the back door (the kitchen 
+_> 16) chimneys), a central chimney stack that warms the main taproom and [via sub-hearths] rooms above, and additional chimneys rising out of the center of the western N wall, the W wall at its SW corner, and the S end of the 
+_> 17) diagonal E wall (in the “point” angle of the wall, and also offering warmth to the adjacent stables).
Aside from the shaft down into Undermountain, the inn has cellars (mainly used for food, ale, and wine storage), but these 
+_> 18) don’t extend farther than the outer walls of the inn, except for a certain narrow secret passage running north that’s still NDA.
And lastly, the Yawning Portal has a jutting signboard (as seen on the cover of WATERDEEP, the 
+_> 19) concluding book of the Avatar trilogy) on a pole projecting from the floor above the ground floor, out into Rainrun Street. This old sign has been salvaged through several inn rebuilds. There’s also a weathervane crowning 
+_> 20) the center of the E-W roofpeak, and lightning rods jutting up at both ends of said roofpeak. Locals recall a memorable night during which Mirt perched on it, singing bawdy songs, but he was likely drunk at the time.

Thu Aug 14 00:24:42 (Halaster, Realmslore, Spellplague, Undermountain, Waterdeep, the Weave)

?_> [@] quick #realmslore question. In 1375DR, Halaster kills himself performing a ritual. In 1492, we find he is still alive. How did he survive, why did he send visions of his death, and what was he up to between 1375 and 1492? 
+_> 1)
Halaster survived in part because he was so attuned to the Weave; when the ritual went awry and his body was rent asunder, his essence was scattered across the planes (some of it being caught in the Weave).
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
The ritual also made use of the Weave, like any arcane magic working, and the manner in which it did left some of his sentience ensnared in the Weave. This gave him time enough to desperately hurl visions into the minds of 
+_> 3) folk with the Gift (and some others) all across Faerûn. He was able to mingle compulsions with some of these visions, succeeding in forcing certain individuals to carry out specific actions. Some of these were “take care of 
+_> 4) this unfinished business for me, as I perish” but other deeds were aids to his own reassembly. However, Undermountain is so riddled with magic (the magic that keeps Waterdeep from collapsing down into it, the wards of the 
+_> 5) city, the nigh-countless localized enchantments cast on various ceilings, pillars, steps, doors, and other elements of the dungeon, and so on) that the Spellplague’s chaotic effects on magic made the interior of Undermountain 
+_> 6) a magical roiling mess, with ripples of magic crashing through each other and rebounding in a wild tangle that fed on itself and built in power for a long time, rather than subsiding as ripples in water do, and this mess 
+_> 7) prevented Halaster being reincorporated (pulling together a new physical body for himself, housing an intact soul within it) within Undermountain, his chosen seat of power, until the Spellplague was over, and its chaos had 
+_> 8) entirely faded.
When this finally befell, and magic was restored to its former stability, Halaster was able to restore himself to physical life. Whereupon he returned to Undermountain and resumed his “mad” life there

Might you share some instances where his spells have gone spectacularly awry, to comedic effect?

Oh, so many mishaps. Let’s choose some of the tamer ones.
There was the time El and Vangerdahast engaged in the wizardly equivalent of “shoot the bottles off the fence” distance marksmanship, with a spell akin to Melf’s Minute
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Meteors, aimed at crenelations on an old stub of disused curtain wall at High Horn. Vangey missed with two and hit with a third; Elminster hit with two and missed with one. Vangey sneered and cast again, blasting the 
+_> 3) remaining crenelations off one end of the wall, then challenged Elminster to clear all the rest, at the other end of the wall, with a single spell. Elminster did that. 
+_> 4)
And in doing so took out the wall, toppling it down onto the High Road in a huge, road-blocking heap of rubble. Which terrified the second road-patrol of the afternoon, as it crashed down INCHES behind them. 
+_> 5)
Then there was the recent occasion upon which El “helped” Laeral track down an elusive noble at a night revel in Waterdeep by working a spell that lofted all living creatures of over a certain size that were in a large 
+_> 6) night-shrouded landscaped noble’s garden into the air, and enveloped them with a strong amber faerie fire glow. The spell worked perfectly, displaying to all quite a few startled courting couples embracing while unclad. 
+_> 7)
Some of them were even married to each other. 
+_> 8)
And then there was a prank El and Caladnei tried to play on Vangerdahast, by switching Myrmeen (as a dragon) with another dragon, while dragon-Vangey was flying in the moonlight over Suzail. El misjudged the swap, and the 
+_> 9) replacement dragon landed with a gigantic splash in the pond in the Royal Gardens, drenching royals and senior courtiers who were conferring about the future of the realm over drinks. The only one left dry and unfrightened 
+_> 10) was the ghost of Alusair, who shrieked with laughter—which only added to the fear of everyone else.
I could go on for days, but. .El WOULD kill me.

Sun Feb 17 20:53:36 (Athkatla, Cormyr, Netherese, Realmslore, Sea of Fallen Stars, Sembia, Suzail, Vangerdahast, War Wizard, Westgate)

?_> Hi [@] not sure if you saw my question before. I think I had some privacy setting stuff going on. Hope you’re recovering well and thanks for still sharing Realmslore with us all on a near daily basis. [:] 
+_> 1)
I definitely didn’t see this earlier! But here we go
As of the late 1490s DR, House Hiloar is still resident in Arabel, with family members also dwelling in Suzail and several Sembian cities. They have continued to diversify
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) notably into investments in Sembian urban real estate that took advantage of the temporary collapse of prices during the Sembian-Netherese warfar, and were largely ignored by the War Wizards in the wake of Vangerdahast’s 
+_> 3) departure from the scene (in human form).
So right now (late 1490s), the patriarch of House Hiloar is Lord Berenthar Hiloar, who dwells in the family mansion in Arabel with his wife Lady Aurandra, his aging aunt and irascible 
+_> 4) terror Lady Hulburtha Hiloar, and their youngest sons, Lords Andlurs, Canthlorn, and Pheldrar.
Berenthar and Aurandra’s three oldest children (like all siblings here, named in first-to-last birth order) are adults (and styled 
+_> 5)
Lords and Ladies): son Durlanthur (heir, and so forced to live in Suzail and increasingly resenting it), daughter Mylandra (very wealthy thanks to being a shrewd investor in shipping and new household items; she collects 
+_> 6) minor protective magics and female lovers she forms firm friendships with, and dwells in Selgaunt), and son Lygard (a bit of a wild rake and adventuring rapscallion who has narrowly escaped bad scrapes in Westgate and 
+_> 7)
Saerloon, and so accepted his father’s “reposting” to Athkatla, where he’s begun his shady adventures anew).
Berenthar has two living brothers, Tonstral in Darrowmar and Felvaran in Luthcheq. Both have outlived their wives 
+_> 8) but have sons and daughters scattered all over the Heartlands and the Sea of Fallen Stars ports, busily pursuing mercantile careers. (These families use their titles when it benefits them, or when in Cormyr, and don’t bother 
+_> 9) the rest of the time.) Tonstral has two sons, one older and one younger than his five daughters: Kuldath, Mierelle (“MEE-air-ell”), Shantra, Valarra, Nove, Naryathla, and Durvrek, all moderately-successful merchants who are 
+_> 10) increasingly investing in crafters who make things, as opposed to their former focus on warehousing, bulk cargo trading, and shipping.
Felvaran has three daughters and a younger son; the daughters (Pelaerra, Alyeene, and 
+_> 11)
Duskarra) are tireless and successful merchant traders and travelers, who may be encountered almost anywhere in Faerûn doing deals and shepherding cargoes, whereas the son, Hondur, keeps to Chessenta and has developed a

?_> [@] That is a great answer, thank you Ed, as always! For the second bakery, you're talking about Shadowdale, but it is supposed to be Eveningstar, right? 
+_> 1)
Yes! Sorry about that. I was reading from my (faded pencil and paper) files and typing them into a computer file, to answer you, and copied out the passages about The Roundloaf from the wrong pages due to them being out of
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) order, probably from the last time I rummaged through them to answer a TSR telephone query, back in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Sigh.
Okay, Dispel Confusion time: Thontravur Shen and his Sembian bride Velveira Almarrand

So Malo’s bakery is in Eveningstar, and The Roundloaf is in Shadowdale.
Here’s what I SHOULD have told you about the second

Eveningstar bakery: two blocks south of the High Road along the Starwater Road, on the west side of the road, stands Harhund’s House, the home and bakeshop of Ulvar Harhund and his six daughters (his wife Alra died in 
+_> 6) childbirth, along with a seventh daughter). Their wares don’t really compete with the loaves and cakes of the Eveningstar Bakery; the Harhunds make just one thing for human consumption: oat cakes.
Most of what they bake is 
+_> 7) horse bread: field peas, beans, bran, or whatever else the local Evenor farms produce an overabundance of, mixed with a little wheat or barley flour to make a heavy wet dough, and baked into small, dense loaves used to feed 
+_> 8) livestock in winter (and often stored inside homes, around the hearth, to keep them dry and inhibit mold growth, so they’re rock-hard and typically smashed with an axe or hatchet before being fed to the animals). Humans CAN 
+_> 9) eat horse bread in a pinch, but it usually tastes terrible. Brigands often steal it from barns, then slice and fry it in a gravy made from wild animals or stolen chickens, boiled down.
By the 1470s, Ulvar is dead and most of 
+_> 10) his daughters have married gnome artisans from Suzail, and their sons and daughters have become the roofers and plumbers (guttering from roofs into troughs, cisterns, and rain barrels) for Eveningstar, cutting slate in their 
+_> 11) own quarries and making their own slow-rust alloys for pipes and gutters, as well as continuing the bakery, which has branched out into becoming a sack factory for coarse-woven grainsacks (and cheap caps worn by most locals). 
+_> 12)
Thanks for the catch, Corentin. Otherwise, Harhund might have remained hidden for years.

Back in the 1970s, when playing D&D with September as my DM, I created Vulkur, a Breckenridge Elkins-like amiable meat-mountain barbarian, bewildered by civilized ways but a faithful sword-brother to his adventuring companions.

I did NOT want that fate, so I imagined he sailed into the Realms, across the planes, and a deity there saw his ship safely to a far shore. That deity I named “Valkur” as an echo of Vulkur, and in memory of dear September

+_> Travis Mayes [@] to [@] you very much for your time and information sir. As a follow up, and you tell me anything about the followers of Myrkul and how they operate? 
+_> 1)
The Gray Ones (or disparagingly, “the Fingerbones”) are back, like the deity they serve, though so far they are as rare as they were before Myrkul was first supplanted as Lord of Death: black-robed priests who bear scythes 
+_> 2) and wear skull half-masks or helms (their robes are always cowled and ankle-length, tied at the waist with a white sash or cord, and in public they often wear full armor beneath them—whereas in temples, they may bare their 
+_> 3) faces and go barefoot).
Although they spread fear of death, they are dedicated to the care of the dying and deceased. They tend folk on deathbeds to make them as comfortable as possible, will communicate their wishes to 
+_> 4) others, and (in return for a “skull fee”) act as an agent for a dead person after death, carrying out provisions of a will and doing deeds the deceased couldn’t complete in life (even when these involve adventuring, long 
+_> 5) journeys, expense or danger).
They travel the Realms to do this, offering burial and funeral services (for modest fees) to the bereaved of the recently-deceased. When assisting the dying, they nurse them, putting comfort and 
+_> 6) freedom from pain first, and treatment to prevent death a close second, but reassuring the dying and their loved ones that death is a natural inevitable, and desirable transition from life to the arms of the gods, and other 
+_> 7) existence, beyond.
Myrkulyte priests preside over funerals, serve as undertakers (preparing bodies for burial), and tend all-faith cemeteries across the Realms (as burial-ground caretakers). They hunt down and take vengeance 
+_> 8) on anyone who vandalizes a cemetery, so such descecrations are very rare.
As before, the Lord of Bones charges his clergy to spread two views of themselves among other mortals: that they are holy servants of utter patience and 
+_> 9) trustworthiness, and that touching a priest of Myrkul will bring certain death. (This isn’t literally true, but there are a handful of Doombringers once more, whose actions spread real fear; they are champions of Myrkul who 
+_> 10) travel the Realms slaying those who mock Myrkul or do violence to Myrkul’s priests.)
Priests of Myrkul are experts about matters of undeath, and often animate skeletons as bearers, aides, and temple guardians. They have 
+_> 11) very few temples, as before, and most of these are reoccupied former temples: crematoriums or mausoleums above dungeon-like subterranean catacombs (burial tunnels and chambers) that are generously supplied with stone 
+_> 12) statues (of dead and decaying humans), gargoyles, and roaming undead.
Kelemvor remains the Lord of the Dead; Myrkul is the Lord of Death, and Undeath, and his priests concern themselves with dying, death, and undeath.

Tue Dec 30 05:43:45 (Forgotten Realms, Netherese, Realmslore, Red Wizards, Sundabar, Sword Coast, Tethyr, Thultanthar, the Realms, the Weave)

?_> Hi [@] I have a random (and very specific!) question for you: what is the approximate ratio of spellcasters to nonspellcasters in the Forgotten Realms? 1 out of 10,000? 1 out of 100,000? Even more rare than that? 
+_> 1)
This gets asked a lot, but here we go again
The answer is always: it depends. Here’s why: literally thousands of sentient beings in the Realms have a ‘wild talent’ for some aspect of magic, due to the world being a-crawl
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) with magic (wielders of the Art using it, drawing on the Weave), and everyone born into the world being exposed to flows of magic. Over time, growing numbers of sentient beings are born with the Gift (ability to wield the 
+_> 3)
Art). Most don’t know it, and are utterly untrained, and stay that way lifelong. Say, 1 in 9,000. A rarer few (1 in 12,000) may or may not manifest a ‘wild talent’ that lets them work magical effects without casting or 
+_> 4) knowing magic. An even rarer few (1 in 26,000) may spontaneously or thanks to a trigger event discover and use a natural ability to work spells by imagination, concentration, and their natural Gift; we call them “sorcerers 
+_> 5)
Perhaps 1 in 130,000 have the desperation or bravery to reach out to try to contact a patron and become a warlock; perhaps 1 in 300,000 succeeds.
However, of that far less rare number of beings that have the Gift (back to 
+_> 6) in 9,000 again), we have an overlap with those who want to dedicate themselves to holy service (about 1 in 4000). About half of these are accepted (1 in 8,000), and of those, about 1 in 6,000 have the ability to wield 
+_> 7) divine magic (as opposed to a deity just channeling a magical effect through them, treating them like a “dumb conduit” and perhaps destroying them or burning out their minds in the process). So IF they follow temple protocols 
+_> 8) and don’t displease the deity, every one of those 1 in 6,000 could become clerics (as in the character class), capable of wielding divine magic. What magic they get given depends on their service, the fervency and 
+_> 9) appropriateness of their prayers, and the mood/nature of their deity. Most clerics don’t get beyond 3rd level spells (the game rules concentrate on PCs, who are the standouts/mavericks/heroes, and can give us a distorted view 
+_> 10) of things).
However, if we go back to beings that naturally possess the Gift, and try to figure out how many become casters of arcane magic, the answer is: those very, very few who can find a tutor, and get taught, and 
+_> 11) survive it.
Those who survive adventuring, or just living in the Realms once others know they can cast arcane magic, are even fewer.
So. .it depends
You said “spellcasters” in your query, and that includes wizards 
+_> 12) sorcerers, clerics, warlocks, and all of the variants and subclasses (druids, illusionists, etc.) which pushes the total numbers up a bit (but again, the game rules and published Realmslore tend to make us think folk who can 
+_> 13) competently hurl mighty spells, or rather, unleash magic with any degree of understanding or control, are more numerous than they really are).
And the totals of, say, trained wizards will vary with time and place; if you look 
+_> 14) at a surviving Netherese city, like Thultanthar (“Shade”), the numbers of arcanists are much higher than if you go out into the frigid wilderness northeast of Sundabar and start looking for wizards. Outcasts in the Border 
+_> 15)
Kingdoms make the numbers higher there than in, say, Tethyr. Cities are almost always far higher than in the countryside, and the countryside higher than in wilderlands, and so on.
So if we decide that the 1490s DR is our 
+_> 16) time, and the Sword Coast countryside is our place, and it’s summer rather than winter (when those who can go south in search of temperatures they can survive, do so), and it’s peacetime, and no local ruler is rounding up 
+_> 17) wizards and imprisoning or executing them, or Zhents or Red Wizards hunting down and slaughtering non-member wizards, we might estimate (and it IS an estimate, mind) that of the 1 in 9,000 who have the Gift, perhaps 
+_> 18) in 40,000 can cast a cantrip or two, and perhaps 1 in 70,000 have and can cast 1st level spells, and perhaps 1 in 90,000 can cast 2nd level spells. Thanks to traveling priests and the teachings of shrine and temple 
+_> 19) clergy, almost everyone has seen minor magic at work (but not personally experienced it), and thanks to bards and talkative traveling merchants and peddlers, nigh everyone has heard tales of spell-duels or spectacular 
+_> 20) spell-hurlings or awesome feats of magic (those MageFairs, for one!), but your average “just plain commoner” in the Realms never actually sees or personally experiences magic being cast, or could hope to begin to afford to 
+_> 21) get trained, or to hire a spellcaster to work one spell for them.
Again, be not misled by game lore and rules, which leave the distinct impression that hundreds, if not thousands, of wizards hurl spells down any given city 
+_> 22) city street in a day.
So: it depends. :}

+_> Trey [@] 5e Sword coast map has some wide lands in the north and east; do you have current or past lore on such places as the Frozen Forest, Turnback Mountains, or the lands about these? [May 21]
Long Reply Thread 1: 
+_> 1)
The best coverage of this area is in Dungeon 170, in the superb MONUMENT OF THE ANCIENTS adventure by Brian R. James and Matt James. Complete with maps of the city of Phlan, the gnoll-held settlement of Frozen Flindyke, and a 
+_> 2) closeup map of the region (full-page map on pg 56 of the magazine).
If you’re venturing north from the Moonsea, you’ll come to the Dragonspine Mountains first. Beyond them is the Ride (cold grassy plains roamed by rothé and 
+_> 3) wolves and fierce, nomadic, feuding tribes of human barbarians), then the White Mountains. North beyond that range are the Tortured Lands (The Leewai), and then the Abbey Mountains; Turnback Mountain is a distinctive tall 
+_> 4) peak about a third of the way west along the range from its eastern end, and in the heart of it (it’s a “middle mountain” with other peaks north and south of it).
Beyond the Abbey Mountains is the Frozen Forest; a chillingly 
+_> 5) cold icewater river, the Alaphaer Run, flows north out of the western Abbey Mountains into the Frozen Forest (and almost right to the step pyramid known as the Monument of the Ancients).
The Moonsea North region is known for 
+_> 6) its sudden changes in weather, often marked by fast-moving fronts that bring violent storms on their leading edges, usually blowing to the northeast. The fiercest weather occurs in afternoon or early evening, and in spring is 
+_> 7) often marked by thunderstorms with racing, widespread lightning strikes. Winter storm fronts often bring abrupt flash freezes, temperatures plummeting and slaying unprotected creatures caught out in the open, only to rise 
+_> 8) slowly over a matter of days ere the next “icejaws” front hits.
Where the Ride is grassy and verdant, naturally well-watered (so growth is inhibited largely by the cold climate and short growing season), the Tortured Lands 
+_> 9) are for the most part parched, though the River Pelauvir does rise at about its east-west midpoint, to run east, bolstered by the Shattersoul River draining out of the Great Glacier; Flindyke stands on its north bank at the 
+_> 10) only bridge over it in the region, Maram’s Span. The western Tortured Lands are rocky, windswept, and largely bare of all life but stunted shrubs and ground-hugging mosses and lichens, a place of foothills, and canyons 
+_> 11) where water once flowed, in warmer times.
The eastern Tortured Lands are mainly dunes of frozen sand, sculpted by the fierce winds into jagged, strange shapes (hence the region’s name). The rugged landscape and severe 
+_> 12) night-day temperature swings make the Tortured Lands a place to traverse as quickly as possible, not to try to tarry or dwell in. Caribou herds and the thick-pelt wolves (and well-armed gnoll hunting bands, with their 
+_> 13) fierce dogs) that prey on them are the most numerous living things roaming the Tortured Lands.
The Abbey Mountains have had their name since the days of ancient Netheril, when Netherese worshippers of Selûne built the Abbey 
+_> 14) of the Moon (now a toppled ruin of shattered stone columns, foundations, and monster-haunted storage cellars) atop Selûne’s Crest, the highest peak of the range. To the gnolls, these are the Rabrae Hyuk (“hyar” is rock or 
+_> 15) loose stone in the gnoll tongue, “hyukla” is a crag or spire, and “hyuk” is a mountain or range of mountains; “Rabrae” is the name of these mountains, an obvious echo/corruption of “Abbey”). The peaks are frigid and 
+_> 16) windswept, only the topmost peaks snow-capped (in contrast to the White Mountains range to the south, whose name comes from their permanent cloaks of snow) and hold relatively few veins of ore worth mining 
+_> 17)
Turnback Mountain” got its name when a group of long-ago prospectors guarded by several bands of hired adventurers against the gnolls and ogres of Thar and hobgoblins, finding little of worth but endless creatures wanting 
+_> 18) them dead, got disheartened by heavy losses and nigh-ceaseless attacks, and decided to turn back.
Perhaps they were prudent, but more recent explorers have reported no less than two dragon lairs and three shattered but 
+_> 19) extensive ruins—perhaps remnants of fallen Netherese flying cities—in the deep and nigh-unvisited-by-humans valleys in the heart of the range.
The foothills along the northern face of the Abbey range are known locally as the 
+_> 20) mammothbacks,” and for centuries have been where treasure is cached, Ride barbarian chieftans are entombed, and gnolls lure rothé and caribou herds into natural “killing trap” funnels caused by the topography. [Thread 1 ends]

Seeing his chance, Zeboaster broke into their rooms, intending to shave off his beard and pose as the merchant. However, he discovered that the man was too short, had

Sat Mar 08 17:26:14 (Realmslore, Roll of Years, the Realms)

?_> 1494 DR in Faerun is the Year of Twelve Warnings.
Q for you: What are the 12 warnings? (Do they warn of 12 different things? Or are they 12 different ways of warning about the same thing?) 
?_> [@] That seems like a question for the great [@] 
I just checked the forgotten realms wiki and it doesnt say much 
+_> 1)
The warnings are about twelve different things. They will take several forms (not several each, but a different form for each): direct divine utterances from temple altars, or signs or portents that can be interpreted in
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) various ways, and may well be misunderstood until “after the fact
In the Realms, a “sign” is something anyone can see who’s in the vicinity, and that lasts long enough for many folk to witness, like the water in a harbor 
+_> 3) changing hue markedly, or a sunset dominated by six bright stars when usually those stars aren’t visible through the light of the setting sun, or a rain from the sky of fish or frogs or locusts.
Whereas a “portent” is 
+_> 4) something more fleeting, like unusual observed behavior: a candle is lit and flies upwards and consumes itself, or poured water “falls” upwards until a jug is emptied, or someone walking across a room levitates unexpectedly 
+_> 5) for a few moments. (Note that in our real world, these definitions are less precise.)
The problem with almost all predictive uses of the Roll of Years is that year-names may hint at major things or very minor things, without 
+_> 6) distinguishing between them. And like all omens, there may be great disagreement over the meanings of what’s observed, until the true meaning becomes obvious (“too late”). I’m reiterating this because such disputes almost 
+_> 7) always arise, as clergies compete to promote the ‘right’ interpretation that increases the importance of ‘their’ deity, and may prevent or overshadow useful predictions (so the actions of adventuring PCs may make a 
+_> 8) difference). If a deity momentarily possesses the mind of a mortal to make them ‘speak in tongues’ (utter words in a language not their own) or in a voice or manner not usual for them, it bespeaks urgency, when a god can 
+_> 9) foresee something the god very much wants prevented. Note that in the Realms, the gods are NOT infallible; they can foresee little better than attentive mortals can. In other words, a god can see out of the eyes of many of 
+_> 10) their own priests, paladins, and sworn zealots if they want to, put together those observations, and so predict better than any lone mortal. It does NOT mean gods can “see the future.” They’re just better anticipators.

Sat Mar 01 01:09:59 (Bahamut, Realmslore)

+_> Matafer [@] [@] wondering if there was an order of knights or paladins dedicated to Celestia or Bahumut in Faerun; post spell plague? Any info would be welcome! #loremaster 
+_> 1)
Yes. An order of paladins dedicated to Bahamut, the True Hands Of Justice, was founded in Shamph in 1489 DR, by Grandmatriarch Darthanna Halarkantle of The House Of Justice, the new temple to Bahamut there. 
+_> 2)
It is small (little more than a dozen roving paladins, plus a handful of knights in training), but dedicated to bringing justice (both adherence to formal law, and the “law-abiding spirit” of respecting the spirit of laws 
+_> 3) and that law and order should hold sway everywhere, especially in frontier areas where there is no Watch, the Order stepping in to be the lawkeepers in lieu.
They enforce the Code of Bahamut (that all sentients have rights 
+_> 4) that the deeds of one should not hamper the freedom of another, that force does not make “right,” that justice lies in trials and evidence and not on-the-spot execution if there’s any doubt about guilt, and so on) if they’re 
+_> 5) in wilderlands, or the laws of whatever government claims the area they’re operating in (except those laws, such as any encouraging slavery, that might offend against the Code). Some of the leading paladins of this Order 
+_> 6) include the human females Jaaluth Darfire (formerly of Selgaunt) and Mararrla Dragonshield (formerly of Luthcheq), and the human male Tarlund Raeraunt (formerly of Arrabar).

?_> [@] Hey Ed. Quick question: What makes Bane/Clergy of Bane this much powerful? Any ideas to make a Banite more interesting than a devouted follower of a multiversal Tyrant/Conqueror? I portray Banites as blindly believers of Bane, who deserves to rule over the multiverse 
+_> 1)
Sure. Bane is Lord of Tyranny, remember, so many Banite clergy work towards firm law and order (and surveillance state) around them. As this makes them as well as their deity fear and hated (also Bane's goals), they scheme a lot. A LOT. Often hiring adventurers 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) as agents/scapegoats. So many Banite clergy are shadowy crime kingpins (prime movers for a lot of plots and conspiracies), particularly in urban settings. They blackmail or otherwise control many rulers, and they are endlessly interesting (dangerous).

The only "blind" belief they have is that pursuing such goals/serving Bane/behaving this way is worthy/proper/is the right thing to do.

Fri Mar 21 19:48:20 (Bhaal, Masked Lord, Realmslore, Waterdeep)

+_> Travis Mayes [@] how viable would it be for an evil cult (Bhaal, Bane, or Myrkul) to set up a shrine/temple in the Waterdeep sewers? For that matter what would they offer their recruits? 
+_> 1)
Not viable at all, considering the city inspectors, the Xanathar agents creeping around, and the gleaners (poor citizens trying to literally dredge and scrape a living from the sewer flows). However, it’s VERY viable for cults 
+_> 2) to set up just a teensy bit higher, in the CELLARS of city buildings. Many cults are already established in such places, and in “upper rooms” of city buildings, too, which has given rise to the local phrase “whispers in upper 
+_> 3) rooms” and “upper room whisperers” (where in the modern real-world we would speak of “back room dealings”).
As for inducements offered to recruits:
Bane: to be an insider in a plot to overthrow the Masked Lords and set 
+_> 4) themselves up in a new tyranny that would rule Waterdeep “properly” and exterminate all nobles, enriching the city and those newly in power (including the recruits) by confiscating all noble wealth and properties. 
+_> 5)
Bhaal: to join a cool, secretive masked by-night fellowship that captures select people and “rightfully” murders them in on-altar rituals to the god (so, the slayings are not a crime, and the cult works to protect you from 
+_> 6) arrest by the Watch and any consequences of the killings). As a joining member, you get to name one candidate the cult will kill (i.e. someone you hate or owe coin to).
Myrkul: to join a small, select faithful whom all fear 
+_> 7) so you’ll be treated with respect; no demands or social obligations will made of you. The undead will serve you; you can command them to do your bidding, including taking your revenges on living enemies and those who owe you.

Thu Apr 17 17:12:27 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] Mr.Greenwood,I have some questions about FR of 5th [:] the module SKT,the All-Father Annam broke the Ordning,which caused a terrible mess on FR.Why AO didn't intervene Annam? 
+_> 1)
The short answer is that no mortal can know why Ao did or didn’t act, in any situation.
However, I can make a more educated guess than most observers of the Realms, and it is this: Ao guides deities, and punishes deities
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) based on whether or not they follow his decrees/guidance, and it would seem since the Second Sundering faded, gods have been forbidden to intervene DIRECTLY in the lives of mortals (that is, by avatars interacting directly 
+_> 3) with mortals, except in private), and encouraged to instead act THROUGH mortals (usually via dream-visions and personal speech with their clergy and others). Kiaransalee sent her avatar to fight mortal (and likely wholly or 
+_> 4) partly non-drow) adventurers face-to-face. In contrast, Annam All-Father, a deity of the giants, shattered the Ordning, a caste system he and his fellow gods of the giants had imposed on all giants long ago. In other words 
+_> 5)
Annam acted within his purview: he had imposed the system, and it lay within his power and portfolio to modify or end it. Whereas Kiaransalee transgressed against Ao’s dictates to ‘stand back more from mortals, directly 
+_> 6) meddling less in their daily lives.’ Ao cares most about the specifics of divine behaviour, not as much about the effects on mortals of that behaviour.

Tue Sep 30 19:17:45 (Calimshan, Cormaeril, Cormyr, Realmslore, Red Wizards, Sembia, Shining Sea, Thay, Toril, Westgate)

?_> [@] do you have any more details on the Westgate noble families around 1371-1372 DR? The Bleths and Cormaerils are already pretty well-detailed, but I haven't found much to differentiate a lot of the others beyond their heads and house symbols. 
+_> 1)
Going to post one noble family at a time, as I get them done 
Athagdal
Patriarch: Haelder Athagdal, “The Wise Goblet” (middle-aged, handsome, an owner of many vineyards and a legendary wine cellar, and a wine connoisseur; a retired rake, has just ascended to 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) running the family upon the death of his father; unmarried and is known to have three mistresses)
Matriarch: Shaeldratha Athagdal, “the Storm Rose,” a faded beauty who was famous for her temper and allure in her younger days, but has much mellowed; Haelder’s  
+_> 3) mother, she’s now a quiet backroom tactician who derives much personal entertainment from manipulating society in Estgate, and thwarting the plans and ambitions of rival nobles she dislikes (most of them)
Heir: Hardrammar Athagdal, a bluff playboy and “blade 
+_> 4) who goes about with a bodyguard equipped heavily with healing potions after losing several duels (he’s about a third as good a swordsman as he thinks he is)
Notable Rakes/Adventurers: Ragdarven, Hardrammar’s smart, wily, and darkly handsome younger brother, a  
+_> 5) schemer and crook involved in smuggling and drug running; Deskult, a scattered, sardonic, and playboy wastrel rogue uncle, who’s only kept in line by two watchful, disapproving, fashionplate (of an elder era) older sisters: Raethra and Hyldra 
+_> 6)
House Athagdal is thought of as “grand old coin, dignified and patrician and cultured.” Firm of word, not crooked, but shrewd in business. Major local builders, landlords, and investors in businesses large and small, owners of much warehousing. Also, major  
+_> 7) investments in Sembian port city warehouses and residential properties. 
+_> 8)
Bleth
Patriarch: Antemnar Bleth, a fat, sulky, glowering man of grudges and great laziness, who believes the world owes him respect and unjustly ignores his high station. Newly come to the “throne of the House,” he sees himself as born into a great house that  
+_> 9) didn’t deserve its exile and disgrace, as the Bleths knew the right road to true greatness and renewal for Cormyr, and were badly treated by ungrateful and envious Obarskyrs and rival noble houses. Antemnar knows some in Westgate call him “the Petulant Toad 
+_> 10) and he wants everyone who does that maimed or slain painfully, until those who are left won’t DARE such insolence. As one longtime (and carefully anonymous) merchant of Westgate described him, “Antemnar Bleth is a large pudding of spite and bile who’d be  
+_> 11) dangerous if he had any drive or practical knowledge of the world. As it is, he’s like a spoiled child, lashing out at everyone who offends him—which is most of us who don’t happen to be named Bleth
Matriarch: Haraklaera Bleth, Antemnar’s bitter 
+_> 12) malicious aunt, a woman governed by her feuds and grudges. Disease recently took her elder brother and his wife, who ruled the family, to their graves, but Haraklaera “the Dagger” firmly believes rival houses had them assassinated, then poisoned with disease- 
+_> 13) coated needles afterwards so the deaths could be passed of as the results of disease-sickness. And who were these rivals? She suspects every last noble house of Westgate and Cormyr, and most of the jumped-up, self-styled so-called "nobles" of Sembia, too. 
+_> 14)
Caustic and eloquent, she glides through life clinging to the tattered remnants of her once-striking beauty, looking more and more like a cadaver as the disease ravaging her (the same one that claimed her kin, that she refuses to admit she has) makes her thinner 
+_> 15) more cadaverously gaunt by the day. Her hobby is strategy games, and she forces handsome male servants to play games with her every evening. If they are wise, they contrive to lose without being obvious about it, so she can triumphantly claim their kisses and 
+_> 16) then send them away spurned.
Heir: Cronlundar Bleth, a handsome and muscular blond swordsman of great skill, who trains daily with the blade to remain a master swordsman and knife-catcher and -thrower. He loves “roistering” about the city with his gang of  
+_> 17) of swashbuckling friends, and is slowly building a network of shady, get-rich-quick business contacts among the shippers and caravan merchants based in Westgate, receiving “carefree spending money” from them in return for being a distraction (by means of  
+_> 18) the vandalism and bullying swordplay of his gang) to cover some of their illicit local deeds. He sees himself as smarter than all of the surviving elder Bleths, and resented his now-dead father (who despised him for being a lazy, wastrel fool, and often said  
+_> 19) so) and his mother, who treated him with contempt, as an “utter disappointment.” Other folk of Westgate see Cronlundar as about a twentieth as smart as he thinks he is (in other words, a full-of-himself dupe and fool).
Notable Rakes/Adventurers: Vlanadar Bleth, 
+_> 20) a known pirate, smuggler, and thief-of-bulk-goods who comes and goes as he pleases, breaking into Bleth mansions late at night through windows and secret doors and passages he knows well, and otherwise having very little contact with his kin. He flits between 
+_> 21) various Sembian ports and Westgate (and, some say, Marsember in Cormyr) in the conduct of his unlawful business, is a sardonic jester and superb swordsman who has an outstanding mastery of balance and so can run along ropes stretched aloft and ship rigging  
+_> 22) without falling, can fearlessly leap from high places through windows or onto lower balconies and roofs, and has many lovers whom he charms with gifts, and uses as safe places to sleep for a night ere moving on. Vlanadar has managed to work with several  
+_> 23) guilds, caravan costers, and the Red Wizards of Thay without double-crossing or earning the ire of any of them, and has profited handsomely thereby. It’s (correctly) rumored that he owns dozens of houses in Sembian ports that he rents out, and one that he  
+_> 24) keeps as a “safe house” haven to run to, and puts his profits into buying ever more real estate. He sees his kin as tiresome blunderers fettered by their bitterness, their grudges, and their sense of entitlement, and won't hesitate to frame them for his  
+_> 25) own misdeeds.
The Bleths are widely known to be a “bad” noble family, justly exiled from Cormyr and stripped of their lands and titles there for treason—and apt to treat anyone who crosses them as a foe to be punished, and anyone who doesn’t fawn on them as 
+_> 26) someone to be blamed or exploited. Widely (and rightly) rumored to be smugglers who deal in drugs and poisons, and who sponsor kidnappings and other “dirty tricks” (like arson) to settle scores or get their own way in many Sea of Fallen Star ports, the  
+_> 27)
Bleths make their open public coin as investors in caravans, urban redevelopments (tall luxury rental “many-mansions” in particular; the Torilian equivalent of five-floor condominium towers divided into a dozen or more units for the wealthy), and fine art  
+_> 28) (huge paintings sold to nobility in Amn, Calimshan—where they’re behind a fad to purchase gilded pictures of dragons and other monsters—and the port cities around the Shining Sea). They also sponsor local coups in many small rural places that result in their  
+_> 29) caravans receiving preferential local treatment, or them owning a controlling interest in strategic wayside inns and warehouses.

Hi Ed, I've heard of Iltyr the "Blind but All Seeing" as a beholder cult that preceeded worship of Tyr in Cormyr. I'm also aware of the Xraunrarr as a beholder group trying to infiltrate and control parts of Cormyr's society. Are the two linked in any way? 
+_> 1)
No, they’re competitors. The Xraunrarr repeatedly tries to manipulate the Cult of the All-Seeing (which is what they call themselves these days), and the Cult resents it and tries to harm Xraunrarr members. The Xraunrarr

?_> [@] I'm guessing votive and sacrificial offerings at divine altars are something that was glossed over in official Realmslore. Anything you can share? Do material offerings vanish to show the diety has accepted it? 
+_> 1)
They were, and are. As was the use of drops of the caster's blood as material components.
Offerings are put on an altar in a temple. On the road, they can be placed in a consecrated bowl, or on any surface or in any depression that's had a symbol of the deity 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) traced on/in it with the offerer's fingertip (preferably traced in blood, tears, spittle, or fire-ashes). Sometimes they vanish as the god takes them (in a temple, often due to a spell covertly cast by priests, to impress the devout, but on rare occasions

The keep was originally a ‘control the dragons, wyverns, and other beasties

Thu Apr 17 18:39:54 (1492 DR, Masked Lord, Realmslore, Spellplague, Waterdeep)

?_> [@] Hello! Sorry if this has been answered somewhere already but a player asked during a session once and I couldn't find an exact number on the # of Waterdeep noble families? (1/2) 
+_> 1)
Sure, happy to help. Throughout most of the 1300s, there were 78 recognized noble families in Waterdeep. (Some additional houses had been previously been exiled and stripped of their nobility, and some had gone extinct.)
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Then, as we saw in CITY OF THE DEAD, a great Realms novel by Rosemary Jones, there came a time wherein hard-up noble families sold their titles, there were assassinations and some noble families fled Waterdeep, only to return 
+_> 3) (or in some cases, ‘pretenders’ CLAIMING to be missing noble families popped up in the city), various commoners claimed ‘extinct’ noble titles they may or may not have been entitled to, and the Masked Lords made some rulings 
+_> 4) about individuals that boiled down to this: Joe Blow here gave us a lot of money, so we’re going to let him call himself a noble Lord of Waterdeep for the rest of his life, but that’s a life title; it DOESN’T extend to his 
+_> 5) family or not-yet-born descendants. Except, human nature being what is, in the chaos following the Spellplague but before the Second Sundering, the families of said Joe Blows DID use and claim noble titles, and a few of them 
+_> 6) got away with it. (There are also nobles descended from someone who sold their title, who claim to be Lord and Lady Assumbar—and who reside in their ancestral mansion, only a few streets away from the Lord and Lady Assumbar 
+_> 7) who are descended from the buyer of the Assumbar title. In this particular case, this mess is complicated by the existence of a longtime Waterdeep-resident commoner family of shopkeepers who claims to be the “REAL House 
+_> 8)
Assumbrar” [note the difference in spelling] and have an ancient document to prove it that may just be an early 1300s DR forgery. And similar difficulties abound.)
Which all boils down to this, as of 1492 DR (the time of 
+_> 9)
Waterdeep: Dragon Heist): there are officially 78 noble families recognized as rightful nobility in Waterdeep. AND at the same time, there are upwards of 130 families living in Waterdeep who claim to be noble, and are 
+_> 10) treated as such by all commoners in the city (because if you want to do business with someone, and not earn their enmity, it’s safest to politely treat them as what they claim to be).
Happy social adventuring!

?_> [@] this is a weird question, but I was wondering about, well, how often elves have to deal with menstruation. Is it monthly, like humans (living centuries with monthly bleeding lol)? Also, what is the typical age they start?

Elves start menstruating at around the same age as humans (i.e. it varies from individual to individual, but they are physically maturing in their “teens,” though “teenaged” is not a term known in the Realms), and remain

It depends on the palate/cuisine of the wayfarer, the climate being traveled through (which can affect what can be readily “picked from the wild” near a campsite, for right-now cooking), and length of journey.
Realmslore [:]

If I was writing down history about this, I would change the word “made” to the word “caused

Where, caused by the widening ripples, the Elemental and Energy Planes collapsed, merging roilingly into the Elemental Chaos.
Shar played lockkeeper, exerting all of her personal power (and she’s one

+_> 7)
Guide).
This changed the Plane of Shadow, and clergy of Shar will tell you that “the Shadowfell” (Shar’s name for the altered Plane of Shadow), was her “creation.” So it is, but she didn’t create it out of nothing. If I took

With its new necrotic energies, the altered Plane of Shadow gained some new properties. Many souls of the dead came now to the Shadowfell, and had to pass through it to get to the Fugue Plane. And—and this was the entire

The spell was cast by Halaster, to dissuade explorers of Undermountain from using the stairs. (He wanted them to run into his other traps and monsters, not avoid them.) He intends the stairs to be maintenance access-ways for

The truth is that Halaster long ago magically tried to magically coerce a baelnorn

His (few) failures gnaw at the Mad Mage of Undermountain’s mind; he took glee in crafting this apparition to toy with, to make up for his defeat

Great Sage, I beg a tale of you.
Namely, I know how Asper and Mirt met, but what does their love story look like? When did our beloved moneylender view her as a wife rather than ward? Details, please

The really, really short version: Asper was a "quiet tomboy" of a youth, very active and very observant (watching Mirt and watching life in Waterdeep). She became adept at scrambling along rooftops, throwing knives and stones and other small objects (e.g
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) windows, from the street below or another building or rooftop), and generally street-smart. In other words, she was very curious about the world around her and wanted to learn all about it (she often used her facility at leaping and climbing to attend noble  
+_> 3) revels as an unseen, uninvited guest, for example). She saw a LOT of human nature, from Waterdhavians high and low, and by adulthood reached the conclusion that she wanted a mate to live out her days in the Deep, and that the one she deemed most fitting

+_> 8) trust between them as well as love was very strong, she eventually convinced him. He insisted on a formal marriage, though, which she was happy to oblige, and then she moved in with him, but maintained her existing rented "digs" in the city and her various

Following the events of DEATH MASKS, the Watch was reformed (to remove any corrupt members loyal to Neverember, Cazondur, the Xanathar, or other ‘independent interests,’ though these reasons were never made public, the Lords

Civilar for North Ward: Melro Darathmrand (burly, short, handsome

+_> 7)
Civilar for Castle Ward: Jharath Meiruk (darkly handsome, longbearded gold dwarf who pretends to be a curt, no-nonsense male but is actually a ‘clanless’ [rejected her kin] female [Laeral and all senior Watch officers know 
+_> 8) this; she specializes in keeping track of merchant traders who visit the city often, who they do business with, and in what goods) 
+_> 9)
Civilar for Trades Ward: Barandrel Helvarth (wall-eyed, perpetually grinning, frequently jesting halfling male; Jharath’s only close friend) 
+_> 10)
Civilar for South Ward: Mamrator Dreskyn (a tall, broad-shouldered and large-jawed, muscular ‘lummox’ of a Tethyrian male, who isn’t half as stone-witted as he looks or acts) 
+_> 11)
Civilar for Dock Ward: Salark Hamandro (a sharp-tongued, sardonic, handsome playboy of a Damaran male, who carries on a friendly running feud-of-words with Mirt; delights in bluntly speaking truth to power, which makes 
+_> 12)
Laeral his champion)
Civilar for Field Ward: Sarelra Druin (a small, slender half-elf female who can pass for a human and even a human youth if she dresses, acts, and disguises herself appropriately; apt to keep silent but 
+_> 13) see all,’ and to forget no name or face; can explode into action if need be, and is deft at hurling knives or batons [naval belaying-pins used to stun or knock cold])

Civilar for Undercliff Ward: Mratchan “Mratch” Krovond (a nondescript, fringe-bearded, tired-looking middle-aged Illuskan man who can be a superb actor when he wants to be) 
+_> 15)
Civilar for Mistshore Ward: Nelcathra “Nails” Thrundsummer (a raven-haired, large-dark-eyed, pouting Rashemi female whose nickname comes from the metal sheaths she wears over her fingers, which look like long metal nails 
+_> 16) and can be used to rake like talons—or what she usually uses them for, which is to impale dozens of small written reminder notes on them, that she carries around and refers to; a cunning combat veteran and former adventurer).

Note: Mistshore burned, and was reduced to a tiny remnant, but it retains a civilar, who now functions as head of spies and the strike force/‘troubles reinforcements’ for the Watch (we would call it the SWAT team). 
+_> 18)
Civilars are now expected to keep discipline and see to training for Watch officers active in their wards, and to be the experts on their wards for any other Watch officers who may need their knowledge, regardless 
+_> 19) of rank; they aren’t expected to be detectives (a few senior Watch officers hold special titles/offices, and their work is to solve murders, trace conspiracies and complex criminal gang plots, and investigate Watch officers).

?_> [@] Great explanation! Which country produces better merchants, Ed? Amn or Sembia?

That's a hard one to answer objectively. Any answer would be a stereotype, as it lumps together everyone in an entire country. If I try an analogy: Amn is more Wall Street (generations of money concentration/ investments/ speculation) and Sembia is more Silicon

+_> 4) really theirs but has to flow through them to reach larger markets/the wider Realms, so they've exploited the labor of others and so ALSO had it easier.
See what I mean about it being hard to judge, and be fair, and how things can be seen so differently?

Sat Mar 01 01:25:08 (Gond, Lantan, Realmslore, Spellplague, Toril)

+_> Z. Daniel Barnett [@] In the next few weeks, my players will be heading to Anchoril in Lantan. I have been able to find very little about the Lantanna online (because those followers of Gond are so insular!) 
+_> Can you offer any information about what might be found on Lantan? Thank you! 
+_> 1)
Lantan was left in physical chaos by the Spellplague, but Lantanese humans and gnomes both survived the devastation, a few in lifeboats of their own prior devising (enclosed rafts with foodstores, gardens, drinking water, and 
+_> 2) solar-powered ovens, heat-sinks, and water-purifiers) and more because they were away from the islands on matters of trade and resource procurement.
When what was left of Lantan reappeared in Toril in 1487 DR, as the Second 
+_> 3)
Sundering drew to a close, these survivors were ready to repopulate and rebuild. And they devoted themselves with vigor and determination to restoring the islands to the way they’d been before the floods—only better (with 
+_> 4) breakwaters and floodwalls, better harbors, and optimized soils, and the submerged island rebuilt and raised above the waves.)
Orlil will take time to recover wholly, though it’s been cleansed of sea-salt much faster than the 
+_> 5) natural cycle of precipitation and storms would function, but lush jungles have already returned to the rest of Lantan, Suj is one island once more, and Lantan is now a gnome-dominated (with a scattering of humans) 
+_> 6)
Gond-worshipping land of small, simple homes that make use of “green” (growing roofs, solar power, and many gadgets; Lantanese kitchens are as filled with gadgets like our modern real-world kitchens) tech, and larger, busy 
+_> 7) workshops and warehouses (for raw materials in, many of them now coming by ship from Laerakond, and finished products out; the Lantanese are selling everything from doglock pistols to improved lanterns and handcarts to 
+_> 8) mainland Faerûn, not to mention clever shipping and storage coffers large and small, with the accent being on useful, well-made, lasting goods that will brighten Lantan’s reputation for reliability and worth-the-coin). 
+_> 9)
Lantanese don’t speak in any detail of conditions on Lantan, or its rebuilding, to outsiders, saying simply that they have had “much rebuilding to do after great storms and floods, and the work continues.” If pressed, they 
+_> 10) will say such things as “We live very much as before” and “Gond provides enlightenment and we provide the labor” and “The jungles flourish, as they have for thousands of years
Aside from small footprint, well-built homes 
+_> 11) and gadgets therein, a major focus of Lantanese innovation has been improved pumps and piping, for moving liquids in bulk from place to place. The former ‘race’ to improve flying machines to be ever larger, more stable, more 
+_> 12) easily navigable, and with backup systems to keep them operable aloft when damaged is more or less on hold for now, as the Lantanese rebuild Lantan.
The priests of Gond govern Lantan, individual Lantanese decide what they 
+_> 13) will personally work on (criminals and those in debt doing the undesirable ‘drudge’ jobs), and barter has largely replaced coin for internal commerce in Lantan. Lantanese have the printing press, they have automated stamping 
+_> 14) mills and molding assembly lines, and they’re perfecting braising and welding, and devising new alloys.
Lantanese don’t have to contend with monsters on Lantan; there are none (and they don’t import live beasts for food or 
+_> 15) or sport or menageries; there are no horses or oxen, there’s people-power, augmented by pulleys and the like). They are suspicious of visitors “stealing their secrets,” and obvious outlanders will be prevented from closely 
+_> 16) inspecting fabricating or alloy-making or experiments and prototypes, and steered instead to artisans creating paintings, sculptures, and windows (the Lantanese don’t mind at all if everyone sees how they make glass windows 
+_> 17) with crank-open casements, and screens), or to warehouses where goods about to be shipped to mainland Faerûn are being packaged for shipment, so samples of those goods can be inspected (perhaps the outlanders would like to 
+_> 18) order something?).
The “old” settlements of Lantan, with the same names, have been refounded, but better roads and bridges constructed; the Lantanna/Lantanese are trying to live more lightly on the land, so there are far 
+_> 19) fewer cleared and cobbled (“paved”) areas, though the realm has concrete, reinforced and otherwise, and even some crude plastics. (Gnome families of Lantan keep the recipes for such things as closely-guarded secrets, even 
+_> 20) from other Lantanese, though the priests will pay compensation for revealing crucial weaknesses, properties, or dangers of specific materials to wider Lantan—and order such revelations.)
Some of the foremost gnome families of 
+_> 21)
Lantan—and these families have been encouraged to settle all over Lantan, not concentrate in specific settlements, so as to minimize place-based rivalries in Lantanese society—include the Blaestones, the Caeleths, the

Dwontors, the Eleglym, the Fornyl, the Handars, the Klavnors, the Muryndars, the Ninestones, the Paunthorls, the Redjynd, the Sabeirynds, the Torroasks, and the Velvaunters.

Fri May 02 02:13:50 (Jhaamdath, Realmslore)

?_> [@] Oh wise sage, what is known of the elven realm of rucien-xan? 
+_> 1)
Rucien-Xan is a hidden elven city-state that, according to tavern tales, has never been found by anyone searching for it, though it supposedly lies in the depths of the Chondalwood, and long ago ruled the nearby elven realm of
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Nikerymath, ere the elves of that kingdom destroyed Jhaamdath.
Rucien-Xan is said to still exist today, though few elves still dwell in its “magnificent halls” (of smooth tunnels, rooms, sculptures, and elaborate pierced 
+_> 3) screens all fashioned of the same magically-fused white stone, that hosts growing mosses that form carpets and the cushioning of built-in couches, seats, and beds).
This is all true, though “Rucien-Xan” and even “Nikerymath 
+_> 4) are human versions of nicknames, not the full and proper elven names of the city and the realm, respectively.
The reason Rucien-Xan (more properly, “Ruucienandrar-founded-by-Arlxandnaea”) has never been found is that it 
+_> 5) exists on its own demiplane (precise whereabouts cosmologically unknown to Elminster), with only the gates (portals) to enter and depart it being found in the Chondalwood: high in the air just above the growing boughs of 
+_> 6) massive trees (so to enter, you climb the tree, and walk out on a huge limb guarded by an elf sentinel to pass through an invisible ‘door in the air’ above the limb, employing the right password—and into a challenge issued by 
+_> 7) several waiting guards in the city). So if the lone sentinel withdraws, there’s literally no sign of the city, on the Prime Material Plane (the elves deliberately cast “driftspells” in the Chondalwood that moderate and 
+_> 8) redistribute moisture and control local temperature for optimum tree-leaf growth, so detect magic spells will find magic everywhere, and not spotlight invisible portals as beacons).

Tue Sep 30 22:24:23 (Cormaeril, Harper, Realmslore, Westgate)

+_> 1)
Cormaeril
Patriarch: Atraeth Cormaeril “the Valorous,” the epitome of the handsome, kind and cultured nobleman, fearless and just, farsighted and wise in the ways of the world thanks to a worldly adventuring youth now firmly behind him. The youngest but last 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) surviving of three brothers (both of whom MAY still be alive, but have never been seen in Westgate, nor contacted their family in more than a decade), Atraeth was trained to run family businesses, understand margins and swindles and the cyclical manner of some 
+_> 3) types of business endeavours, and to be patient and know when to withdraw, keep silent, and be inscrutable. He has made the Cormaerils very wealthy in Westgate, Turmish, and Chessenta as a result, investing in crops, farmland, urban holdings in cities that are 
+_> 4) expanding, and in herds of edible livestock. Profits are then reinvested in clothing concerns, superior cobblers who make “fine boots,” and rental urban real estate, and by these strategies the Cormaerils are now (very quietly) stupendously wealthy. Atraeth  
+_> 5) remains a soft-spoken man of few words, who loves reading and quiet discussions of world affairs over maps, with weary Harpers and others in want of a good bed, secure roof, and a fine meal for a night. The Cormaerils are one of the few families to pay for a  
+_> 6) private family Triad chapel in their Westgate mansion so they can have priests in the household to “heal all who need it
Matriarch: Atraeth’s wife, Raeleira (“Rail-LEER-ah”) Cormaeril, was born a Thalavar, and the two noble families are growing closer as a  
+_> 7) result of their happy marriage (and six daughters). Known for her long, glossy mane of black hair and her unfailing courtesy and impeccable “blush” (makeup) and wardrobe, Raeleira has a brilliant, creative mind and is a shred judge of individuals, so she can  
+_> 8) see new ways of doing things, trends, and foresee how many folk will react to changes. Atraeth is wise enough to, since their marriage, let his wife make all major business and investment decisions for the family, and admires her wits. She has rather plain  
+_> 9) features and a slim, almost boyish build, but he loves her deeply for the bright and kind person she is, and they remain smitten with each other, romantic lovers still tenderly intimate (as Aunt Arautha says cattily, “tenderly intimate every damned night, all  
+_> 10) over the house!”).
Heiress: Eirlandra (“AIR-lan-drah”) Cormaeril, a shy, beautiful, tall blonde romantic who has an unfortunate tendency to fall head over heals in love with handsome strangers who dress and act like adventurers, even when they’re really timid 
+_> 11) merchant clerks or dock laborers on holiday. Raeleira has assigned no less than four very-well-paid family servants (former adventurers, all female) to be Eirlandra’s maidservants and to follow and spy on her and swoop to the rescue if she gets herself into  
+_> 12) danger (including the danger of being deflowered by the latest guy or gal she’s hopelessly in love with), and luckily Eirlandra falls out of passion as quickly as she falls in, and learns a little more about the world with each passing “smite” and so is  
+_> 13) becoming more discerning about who she falls for. Eirlandra is fascinated by arcane magic, and can wield the Art, though her parents are slowing her training in hopes she’ll become worldly-wise and sensible before she starts hurling fireballs everywhere. 
+_> 14)
Notable Rakes/Adventurers: Arautha (“Arr-OTH-ah”) Cormaeril, an unwed, fiery-tempered, cantankerous, cigar- and pipe-smoking and garrulous old gossip who dresses revealingly in all the latest fashions despite being a leathery seventy-odd winters, and has a  
+_> 15) teasing or sarcastic opinion on everything and everyone. She escapes being tiresome because she takes life with such good humor, and because she’s as smart as Raeleira but doesn’t resent her or anyone, so her opinions are often informed and well-founded. She  
+_> 16) also has a wild talent for deflecting hostile spells and “having a feeling” when someone has mastery of the Art and/or is wearing or bearing a magic item, even covertly. She can be good company and has been known to lead outlander adventurers on tavern  
+_> 17) crawls, on a whim, or even join them on adventurers (armed with her alert wits, deep knowledge of Westgate’s shadier establishments and alleys, and her personal collection of combat-handy magic items—known to include a corset that can fire sleep-poisoned  
+_> 18) breast-spikes).
Widely held to be a ‘good’ noble family (folk of their word, who behave honorably and avoid shady activities), the Cormaerils are on the quiet and aloof side, though they contribute generously to noble causes and work to make life in Westgate  
+_> 19) better for all. Not only do they believe this is the duty of all nobility, they think life in any city or realm is better if the poorest folk have better lives and see ready means of making coin, and so avoid lawlessness and lift themselves out of squalor.

+_> 1)
Darg is a human male given name among the barbarians of the Sword Coast, and Darg as a short form of Dargil, Dargyl, Dargar, and Dargarth in humans of Amn, Tethyr, Cormyr, Sembia, the Dales, and Starmantle (and of course
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) everywhere else in the Realms, spreading slowly along the caravan routes).

Fri Nov 28 04:39:21 (Gargauth, NDA, Realmslore)

+_> Pedantic This Week [@] a question about Gargauth. In terms of lore, he is persona non grata in Baator, having been exiled under threat of extreme pain. Why is it then, he believes that going back to Baator would allow his release from the shield? 
+_> 1)
Gargauth believes he’ll be freed from the shield because when in Baator (only) he can shift into three other forms not available to him elsewhere: an amorphous ozzing inky-black mass of many tentacles; a tatter-edged, semi-tangible wraith-like form that visually 
+_> 2) resembles an allip; and a larva-like form with two tiny arms jutting from the sides of his head. He thinks “going wraith” will allow him to seep out of the shield. 
+_> Pedantic This Week [@] - how exactly did he get trapped in the shield? It used to be an artifact via which he communicated with his followers. What led to his imprisonment and why did he not direct his followers to take him to Baator  
+_> if that's where he thinks he'll break free? 
+_> 1)
Some details are NDA, but it’s very likely he got trapped in the shield due to an entrapment spell laid on it by a mortal mage seeking to imprison Gargauth and harness his power—that succeeded because Asmodeus saw that casting and thought that trammeling Gargauth 
+_> 2) would be a good idea. Gargauth doesn’t want his followers to take him to Baator because he can “feel” the hand of Asmodeus in the enchantment that has entrapped him, and suspects Asmodeus (because of certain words that passed between them, at their last  
+_> 3) meeting) will be waiting there to seize the shield and kill Gargauth slowly and in torment, draining his powers over some years to enchant various items. (You’d be surprised at how many powerful beings are being-drained captives, in various hands, scattered

Among the farms and lands that flank the coast of Cormyr between Blustich and Dawngleam, are there any edible, flowers or "pick as you walk" plants that travelers rely on for snacks or "we've nothing else, let's eat this" foods? 
+_> [@] Sure. See three of the Amarune's Almanacs: Forests, Grasslands, and Coasts. Elengur (wash-weed), Mammurth, Wuthdrar, and Yamril are all (surprisingly) plentiful, growing wild. If you can outrun farmers, quince and sloes are common "fence-hedge" crops.

?_> [@] I'll ask! 
?_> [@] [@] the word is that while the trade edition is to be the perennially in-print version (doesn't that sound lovely?), I'm also told the trade will be much lighter than the hardcover and DAW hopes that will help? 
+_> [@] Thanks! Will buy, and take to senior and she'll see. Would hate to do surgery to turn a book into lighter halves/thirds/quarters, as I cringe at treating books so, but might be necessary. Sigh.
I'll let you know. I decry the no-mass-market trend. Serves no aging readers well. 
+_> [@] This particular senior first noticed it with Donna Leon's mysteries; after the first few, no mass markets, only trades using same formatting as hc. Then Anne Perry releases followed suit. Sigh.
Yet thank you much for asking DAW. I miss the days when I could phone DAW himself. 
+_> [@] And yes, perennially-in-print version DOES sound lovely. Hope it is meant. There was a time, in the mid-1990s, when only TSR D&D paperbacks were truly always in print (my Spellfire mm was in print for 32 years!). 'Twould be lovely to see those days return. 
+_> [@] I recall talking to an elderly English publishing exec once at BEA (he AND his firm are both gone now) who was proud of keeping every title they published in print, forever, and stipulating that anyone who bought the firm had to agree to continue. He told me firmly, chin up 
+_> [@] "If we didn't think a book shouldn't be available to all readers across the planet, forever, we wouldn't have published it in the first place
Surprised how close to tears remembering that dedication brings me, now. A simpler time, when principles weren't bent or abandoned. 
+_> [@] And yes, I very much believe that THE GOSSAMER MAGE should be in print now and unbroken, until the end of days. When aliens decipher our writings to try to see what, if anything, was good about humanity, it's one book they should definitely read.

?_> [@] do you have any more details on the Westgate noble families around 1371-1372 DR? The Bleths and Cormaerils are already pretty well-detailed, but I haven't found much to differentiate a lot of the others beyond their heads and house symbols. 
+_> 1)
Malavhan
Patriarch: Welvlarand Malavhan, a cold-eyed (pupils like pale green ice), mustachioed, dark-haired (but going white at the temples) man of culture and taste. Always immaculately groomed and stylishly dressed, but not fussy about it, and won’t hesitate to
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) enter a brawl or dance or engage in something that will raise a sweat. Calculating, calm, fearless, and thinks “the lower orders” are far too ruled by their appetites and emotions—to deserve to lead, and to stay at the top, one must be clear-headed, a  
+_> 3) thinker, and ruthless/dispassionate. Is always interested in the new, and trends, and future possibilities.
Matriarch: Bareldaera (“Bar-rell-DARE-ah”) Malavhan, wife to Welvlarand and publicly near-mute and subservient to him, but in private his queen who  
+_> 4) commands and controls him absolutely. Glossy-dark-haired, voluptuous beauty with large, liquid blue-black eyes and of tall stature and graceful gait. Tends to be dressed in ankle-length gowns with cutaways at all times (even in bed). A Waterdhavian  
+_> 5)
Roaringhorn by birth, she is inquisitive and keen-witted and a master at seeing consequences and how apparently disparate social elements will go together/affect each other. Like her husband, always superbly dressed and groomed, but like him, doesn’t care a  
+_> 6) whit if she gets dirty or her clothes ruined; life is what matters, not one’s image. (Bareldaera speaks like that; even if describing herself, she will say “One does this, because one desires to. One habitually takes an interest in. .”) 
+_> 7)
Heir: Saklaerath (“Sack-LAIR-ath”) Malavhan, a tall, ruggedly handsome, long-flowing-blond-haired, burly man with a long, straight beak of a nose, who doesn’t at casual glance look to share any lineage at all with his parents (he looks so different from them) 
+_> 8) but is indeed their fullblood son. And much older than his two younger brothers, Ruandjack and Meirrand, and his youngest-of-all sister, Mraethe. “Sack” is fascinated by adventurers, and dreams of being one—not so much fighting monsters or delving underground 
+_> 9) but traveling the Realms, heading this place or that on a whim, free of the social demands of being a noble and of the crowding and nastiness of Westgate, which he hates. He wants to see wilderland vistas, forests, rolling farmland, and breathe fresh air 
+_> 10)
He doesn’t mind sleeping rough or working for good immediate reason (like cutting firewood, or felling a tree for a shelter for the night), but doesn’t—thanks to his family’s wealth—see any need to work hard, daily, for a living, and if confronted by a bossy  
+_> 11) employer, would likely land a punch on the nose of such an irritant and walk away, for good.
Notable Rakes/Adventurers: none living
House Malavhan, the Crimson House (so-called because all living members love this hue, and the major chambers of their Westgate
Realmslore 
+_> 12) mansion, where they entertain, are walled in crimson hangings), are major landlords and shippers, who own many caravan wagons, sponsor several competing caravan costers, and are increasingly investing in cogs and caravels that sail the Sea of Fallen Stars 
+_> 13)
The family philosophy is “charge reasonable fees, insist on prompt payment, and invest the takings, avoiding big bold gambles that MIGHT pay off in future, and investing in wars or guild struggles or controversy. Make small, steady coin every day, and wind up  
+_> 14) far ahead of those who splash their coin about or try to shove the world into new paths for possible gain

Sat Aug 30 05:08:39 (Spellplague, Larloch, Realmslore, Shadowdale, Table Magic, the Weave)

?_> [@] night Great Sage from Shadowdale. A curiosity: how did the Spellcasters (Wizards) manage to use magic without the use of Weave during the post-spellplague years from 1385 DR to 1475 DR? I believed that only Shadovars (Shades) used magic without using Weave. 
?_> [@] did Wizards dominate raw magic without Weave? Pluma and Hishna magic certainly worked without Weave interference, just like the obscure Halruaan technique know as Table Magic, but standard magic does not! That would be the doubt. 
+_> 1)
The Weave is just one way of accessing the natural powers of the world (wind, tides, convection currents/heat/sunlight, magnetism, flowing water and other kinetic effects, etc.) by non-purely-physical means (like digging or damming), which are collectively 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) referred to as "magic." There are many others, but the D&D game system concentrates on the Weave-based ones because they are the fastest (which matters, when you're fighting for your life!). By experimentation and consulting old grimoires (in Candlekeep 
+_> 3) various temples and royal and court and sages' libraries) for hints of other ways of spellcasting, arcane spellcasters found other ways. Steadied by the Weave, because it did NOT collapse entirely thanks to Mystra's foresight in establishing Weave anchors 
+_> 4) both living (e.g. the Chosen) and nonliving (e.g. the Athora), the continued existence of Azuth, and some other factors, some as yet unrevealed. 
+_> 5)
Quite a few creatures use magic without accessing the Weave (even monsters, when we refer to them in the rules as having "spell-like powers/abilities"), not just shades. The study of magic is a rabbit hole that some individuals (like Larloch) devote many  
+_> 6) lifetimes to, without ever getting near a full or complete understanding of current magic ("current" because magic is not static, but a living, growing thing over time, thanks to the innovations of many sentient creatures).

Sat May 10 19:43:54 (City of Splendors, High Road, Realmslore, Savage North, Sword Coast, Waterdeep)

+_> 1)
So, from the Adventurer’s Guide booklet in the 2e City of Splendors boxed set, you likely already know that The Golden Harp is a Sea Ward two-storey inn (standing on southfront Skulls Street, in the block between
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Copper Street and The High Road), that features a magical harp that entertains patrons.
Here's more
It's a comfortable, solidly-built stone structure with a steeply-pitched slate roof, noisy during hailstorms and heavy rains 
+_> 3) but otherwise very quiet due to its solid construction. It’s both cozily-furnished (with comfortable overstuffed seating, well supplied with pillows and cushions, many tapestries and wall-hangings. and woven rugs underfoot 
+_> 4) throughout; and well-heated (every room having its own fireplace). It’s also well-lit and ventilated, and the staff are cheerful without being loud or intrusive; it tends to attract a clientele of similar mien.
The upper 
+_> 5) floor is devoted to fourteen small guestrooms, the servants sleep in the dormered attic above, and the ground floor is devoted to garderobes, kitchen and pantry, and a large common room comfortably furnished with coaches 
+_> 6) around the walls broken by small sidetables, and round wooden dining tables currounded by chairs in the center. The cellar is low-ceilinged, damp, and given over to a workshop (furniture repairs and reupholstering), a 
+_> 7) laundry, and keg and bulk vegetable (mainly potatoes and carrots) and fruit (mainly apples) bin storage.
Since the early 1300s DR, this inn has been known for the illusory golden harp that appears briefly, on random evenings 
+_> 8) floating in midair near the ceiling of the common room (in the same central spot, though if this spot is deliberately occupied, it will appear nearby) to sing and play ancient Sword Coast and Savage North ballads by itself. 
+_> 9)
Some long-ago patrons attempted to make this feature disappear by use of dispel magics, but each time, it reappeared shortly thereafter. There are various conflicting tales told of the harp’s origins, but which, if any, of 
+_> 10) them are true has been lost to time. The most popular story says that this is a haunting, the legacy of Sharaerra Valeth, a bard who built the inn (as a private family mansion), a lady who lived happily in what is now “the 
+_> 11)
Harp” for many years, and died in what is now the common room of the infirmities of old age—but died while actually playing and singing, to entertain her children.
The inn has changed very little from the 1470s through 
+_> 12) s, being known as a quiet, cozy ‘home away from home,’ not haughty or showy, but a relaxing haven. Under motherly, quietly efficient innkeeper Alanna Falark (CH hf W2 [knows mainly useful cantrips, but can defend 
+_> 13) herself]) and head cook Omdurl Surlhond (LN hm F4 [retired, but can still throw a cleaver or filleting knife with deadly aim]), the Harp serves simply, heart fare of a roast boar or oxen dish every evening with fresh fish 
+_> 14) dishes also available, and soups and tarts (meat, vegetable, and berry) available at all times. It has a small but good range of wines, a few liquors, and ale, stout, and porter (brewed nigh Amphail) on tap.
Like all Sea 
+_> 15)
Ward inns, the Harp is pricey (2 gp/night with all meals but only ales and water to drink included, other drinkables extra, and stabling 5cp/beast atop that, plus 2 sp if a wagon or carriage must be housed, “under secure 
+_> 16) guard,” out back). Many a successful merchant prefers to stay here when in Waterdeep; one of them long ago cited the Harp as a “drama-free restful haven,” and that remains true.

?_> [@] Whilst I consider you the ultimate authority, I thought that in dragon heist it states that luskan is ran by jarlaxle Baenre the leader of the bregan de'aerthe who is trying to convince the lords alliance to recognize luskan as a legitimate member state? [:] 
+_> 1)
Jarlaxle "declared himself" its secret lord. He is indeed trying to get Luskan standing with the Lords Alliance, and he is sponsoring and propping up the High Captains. Like Arklem Greeth, Jarlaxle is far too wily to openly rule. Jarlaxle wants Luskan to be the

+_> 2) open trading port for Bregan D'aerthe.
But Jarlaxle is spread far too thin to truly rule anywhere; he's trying the exact same thing in Neverwinter and in Waterdeep, hoping he can achieve effective rule in any of them. If the Arcane Brotherhood would go away 
+_> 3) he could most easily achieve true (but behind the scenes) rule in Luskan. But saying Jarlaxle "runs" Luskan is like saying a downtown street gang leader "runs" Chicago or New York. Leans on folks to try to get his own way, yes, "runs," no. He's trying to  
+_> 4) wield and claim powers he doesn't really have, yet, in hopes folk will let him get away with it.
In other words, the situation has been masterfully set up by [@] to make for maximum play opportunities for your PCs.

Mon Mar 03 03:12:50 (Luskan, Mirtul, Realmslore, the Realms)

+_> CONTINUED:
Belial Lyka [@] Heya, Ed. What kinds of flora and (non-monster) fauna might one encounter travelling the Northern Means and then Ten Trail from Luskan to Ten Towns? If seasonality has bearing on it, the period would be Tarsakh going into Mirtul 
+_> . though elsewhen'd be interesting, too. 
+_> 1)
PART TWO OF REPLY:
This holds true for the second leg of the journey, too, via Ten Trail through the mountains. There’s less cover in the rising, rocky country for ambushers, but more access to stones they can fling down at 
+_> 2) wayfarers, though avalanches grow less and less likely as the years pass, and the loose rock that can readily fall has already done so, leaving the road in an increasingly-wide, relatively safer pass.
The Trail follows 
+_> 3) deep-cut stream gorges, and there’s always the danger of falling—and even, in spring or when the (very rare) earthquakes hit, of portions of the road breaking off and plunging down into the neighbouring gorge. 
+_> 4)
Hundelstone (which I gave some details about in tweets a few days back) is the supply center along the way, and armed “guides” (bodyguards) can be hired there to accompany you on your journey, typically for a 5 gp fee plus 
+_> 5) costs (generous patrons give costs plus a tip, bringing the total to 8 or 10 gp, upon safe arrival in Bryn Shander).
Ice that can be sucked on, or melted in a cauldron over a fire, is plentiful in the mountains, but food is 
+_> 6) scarce, as anything that can be reached from the road without perilous scrambling has typically already been harvested by this time of year. The Trail is busy, though the depths of winter is its time of lightest use, and 
+_> 7) veterans avoid “the fog times” as the most dangerous for ambushes and for traveler and beast to slip and fall; a broken leg can mean death in this country.
Stands of trees are almost entirely absent between Hundelstone and 
+_> 8) the north bank of the Shaengarne, with only stunted lone trees clinging to high ledges here and there. Mountain goats and snowcats inhabit these peaks, but are rarely seen from the Trail. Perytons, eagles, hawks, and 
+_> 9) vultures are more likely sightings, as none of them move south for winter, and all will be ravenous by this time of year save the vultures, who are usually well-fed by now, some years even approaching fat and lazy. 
+_> 10)
The saddle or high point on the Trail is Three Daggers Ridge, home to a windswept campground and little else, a dragon skeleton that used to festoon it having being entirely carried away, bone by bone, for sale to alchemists 
+_> 11) and noble collectors over the years (beware back-alley shops in Bryn Shander offering to sell you the dragon’s skull, fangs, or talons; they are passing off wyvern skulls and fake fangs and talons carved from the long-frozen 
+_> 12) bones of giant rothé).
No brigand could make a living on the Trail, but there are some who head out from Bryn Shander posing as legitimate travelers, only to turn and attack travelers who reach the Ridge just behind them. 
+_> 13)
The Trail emerges from the mountains between two peaks known as Hartooth and Marlaxe, after dwarves who perished under the jaws of wolves hereabouts in the late 1200s DR, then switchbacks down a steep slope to the rail-less 
+_> 14) bridge over the narrow but deep Shaengarne Gorge, known to folk of the Ten Towns as “the Sword Cleft” (to them, it’s where their country ends, and the dangerous and strange ‘rest of the Realms’ begins). 
+_> 15)
Trees remain rarities from the Cleft on to Bryn Shander, but you’ll see countless drumlins and eskers, cloaked in snow and ice, on all sides. Many rills and brooks can be heard running under this “whitecloak” and the 
+_> 16) approach of any creature of size can be observed from some distance away—unless ground-fog or a blizzard rolls in, and brings a complete whiteout.
At other times of year, subtract the fog and add a little warmth, a lot of 
+_> 17) insects, and cover in the form of foliage to that part of your journey that lies south of Hundelstone, and you now know what you’ll see along your way. The gods grant you safe travels.

However, to answer you seriously: by wizardry alone (mastery of spells, experience with using them, creativity in making new ones and modifying existing ones, and understanding the underlying raw magic—and leaving out the

If you do factor in sanity and rank them by effectiveness in battle, on their own and without items and not on

From the first, Dagult Neverember was ambitious. Not just for personal gain, but for bettering the world. CHANGING the world. Over time, like many, his impatience with those who got in his way, or disagreed with him, grew.
And he liked power, and wielding it.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
He also grew to like being wealthier (that is, gaining from his use of power). So he made sure that the things he did made him wealthier, and gained him more power. And he slowly became less and less patient with impediments, and moved towards becoming a tyrant. 
+_> 3)
He saw himself as a transformational force who deserved more power because of the good he was achieving. But Waterdeep has seen many, many such people, and seen through them, too, and eventually flung him out of the Open Lordship, slapping him down.

In doing so, they shattered not just his pride, but his delusions. He had to face what he'd become.
But he liked who and what he was, so he "doubled down," in current parlance, and became more so, when back in Neverwinter.
Or to put things in shorter but more

As per the game rules, all living things have an animating spirit. Sentient beings also have souls. Even intelligent creatures can no longer learn if they lose their souls. (Instinct is different from learned experience.) 
+_> 2)
So a soul and sentience are inextricably linked.
As a DM, I would rule that the moment you have full self-awareness, defined as the ability to “put yourself in another being’s boots” or see other points of view/appreciate the 
+_> 3) world-view of others, you have a soul. Which means plants and lower-intellect animals (value judgment implicit, but if an animal is incapable of training by sentients, or loyalty to a species other than its own, it’s ‘lower’)

?_> [@] Two questions about the Faithless: 1) It’s said that those who had no patron deity end up in it. But I thought many, perhaps most Faerûnians worship many gods more or less equally; who would be their “patron”? 1/2 
+_> 1)
A very small handful of sentients in the Realms truly don't believe deities exist (less than 0.5%); they would be the "Faithless." Most DO "believe in" all the gods, even if they profess to repudiate them. Many 'cleave to' one deity above others, even if slightly.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
That 'ever so slightly favored' deity is their patron deity, if they don't openly profess and embrace a patron (as clerics and paladins do). The Wall of Faithless is more of a bugaboo tale told by priests and spread over tavern tables than it is a Great Big Doom.

?_> 1/11
I have a break from work so a a little more on D&D talk today and then I promise i’ll talk about something else 
?_> 2/11
Current times are kind of highlighting the need for socialising and a sense of connectedness. There are lots of great ways to achieve that and with tech like Roll20, D&DBeyond, Fantasygrounds, Discord #DnD is one of those. 
?_> 3/11
As I mentioned yesterday, I have been a huge fan of #DnD since I was little, but for a long time I had no one to play with. D&D wasn't cool, especially where I grew up #2037 #2016!
So I played CRPGs (computer RPG) and I read the books. 
?_> 4/11
I realised this immersed me in the stories that were a part of the greater narrative.
Baldur’s Gate is still my favourite game series of all time. #BG3 
?_> 5/11
I have read 30+ years of Drizzt and Companions of the Hall stories from [@] 30 years of continuity, it’s hard to find that. I expanded into [@] and [@] [@] to name a few greats! #SageOfShadowdale #BrimstoneAngels #ErevisCale 
?_> 6/11
I felt connected to the characters, their stories and the overarching universe so to speak.
D&D has exploded into so much more than just that now though :) 
There is an ever expanding community and an estimated 13mil+ players globally. 
?_> 7/11
This has opened up new doors for entrepreneurs and creativity.
One of the most famous examples of this right now is #CriticalRole. There is a lot to love about CR. 
?_> 8/11
Their success with their weekly streams has allowed them to branch out into sold out live shows, art shows highlighting community artists, kickstarter records for upcoming animated version of #VoxMachina and official books and comics. 
?_> 9/11
But the great thing that they do is pay forward as much as they can by engaging and promoting their community which in-turn drives their success. 
?_> 10/11
There are so many opportunities now, from writers such as [@] 👋🏿, to artists like [@] dice makers [@] and clothing [@] It’s incredible to watch the growth. 
?_> 11/11
But how many other First Nations people are out there working or have businesses in the TTRPGs space? Hit me with any that you know! [:]

And fantasy and sf writing has more than you'd expect; one of my stablemates for a time was Owl Goingback.

?_> [@] I'm interested in something you published on Twitter a few months ago. Do you have any Twitter postings regarding Weave Anchors. I believed there were some mentions about certain wizards who serve in the function and purpose for Mystra, Lady of the Weave. 
+_> 1)
Ao commanded Mystra to vest some of her divine essence (the silver fire) into mortals, in part to lessen her power, which in magic-rich Toril far outstripped the other gods. She did so, but had the foresight to anchor the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Weave in these mortals, as well as in more static natural concentrations of magic (such as the Athora) to keep the Weave (herself) from collapsing if anything happened to her. (This is also something Ao expected and wanted 
+_> 3) her to do; it isn’t just insurance for Mystra, it increases stability for the world.)
Many of these Weave anchors are also Mystra’s Chosen (the mortals who loyally serve her, whom she trusts the most) and are Weavemasters 
+_> 4) (know how to manipulate the Weave directly, not just through arcane spellcasting), but not all, and many of them (such as Volo) may even be unaware they are Weave anchors. Being a Weave anchor doesn’t involve doing anything 
+_> 5) except existing; your presence focuses and stabilizes the Weave around you if you’re a Weave anchor. Disjunction and anti-magic and dead magic effects tend to fail or fade in your immediate vicinity because you’re a Weave 
+_> 6) anchor, but otherwise you will experience very little difference in your life if you aren’t also attuned to the Weave. (That you know of; in reality, you will live longer naturally, and Mystra will watch over you and rescue 
+_> 7) you miraculously from time to time if need be, which is why Volo seems to lead a charmed life).
So Elminster, Storm, and The Simbul are all Weave anchors and know it, but there are also plenty of mortals serving as anchors 
+_> 8) who are less likely to be seen as likely anchors and targeted by a foe of Mystra, or someone wanting to wrest control of magic to themselves, or just to destroy (like Shar). These “less likely” anchors include the likes of 
+_> 9)
Mirt and Durnan, as well as Volo, but most of them remain secret for their own protection and so as not to interfere with their lives (if they don’t know, it doesn’t influence their thinking, dreams, or actions; much kinder 
+_> 10) to them). This also, of course, makes it very easy for a DM to have anyone be, or not be, a Weave anchor, as they see fit.

+_> 1)
Hi! Sounds like great fun (and a lot of work!).
The Halls map WAS accurate (in the 1460s), but a spell-duel shattered much of the then-taproom/Shaft Room and the two floors immediately above it, resulting in (after temporary rebuilding) what can be seen in

WATERDEEP: DRAGON HEIST (pages 18-19). Which in turn has been "properly rebuilt" since then, to fill in the open well into the upper floors (to restore more rentable inn rooms and cut down on the night carousing noise into those floors).
And these rebuilds

+_> 1)
The aranea produce webbing in direct proportion to how much food they ingest. Ere going to bed at night, most exude the webbing they haven’t used during the day (i.e. almost all of it, unless they’ve used some fighting
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) hunting, climbing, or “sticking” tools to their grasps during work that demands such measures), and save it in boxes lined with an ointment that keeps it supple. These collected “sheddings” are woven by skilled elder aranea

+_> 4)
Many aranea families have indolent elder aunts and uncles who staff the family kitchens all day, and are sampling gluttons, so they, individually, produce a LOT of webbing. (The statblock numbers are a racial average.)

?_> [@] Thanks for answering! When you mentioned roads What kind of roads are in Sword Coast at the end of 15 century DR, for example? Say "High Road", or "Trade Way"? Is it wide cobbled kind of road, or dirt road? 
+_> 1)
I answer similar queries every 2 months or so, so this answer is a retweet:
Some major roads in places like Waterdeep are wider than 50 feet; the idea being that you can easily turn a large wagon drawn by three pairs of oxen
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) yoked in harness one in front of the other. (See real-world American brewery wagons, back in horse-drawn days.)
Dotted-line-on-maps roads/wagon trails have at least 30 feet of ‘crown’ (traveled area), with a grassy verge of 
+_> 3) about another three or more feet per side before pitching down into grass-lined drainage ditches, on either side. The idea here being that wagons can easily pass each other without danger of wheels catching, or 
+_> 4) projecting-to-the-side loads snagging on each other. So, 30-foot minimum, except when cutting through rock (mountain passes/prime ambush areas!), and wherever the road comes out onto exposed bedrock, the cleared area widens 
+_> 5) into a layby/stopping area/turning area.
Follow up question: In town (in Amphail) would the Long Road be dirt, cobblestones, or Roman road?
In Amphail, it would be a combination of crushed-rock gravel, crushed-old-pottery-roof 
+_> 6) tiles gravel, and flagstones. (So, yes, Roman roads. ;} ) Dirt is to be avoided, as it turns into mud and potholes too readily.
For this mud-and-potholes reason (which in turn causes subsidences and eventually building 
+_> 7) collapses), cities that have sewers/gutters/catchbasins and other ‘guided drainage’ will have a layer of cobblestones over top of the gravel. Cobblestones are heavy and expensive, so will be used elsewhere only if necessary. 
+_> 8) (Cities have residents who can be taxed annually, or by special levies, to pay for paving work.)
Swampy areas tend to have ‘log roads’ (VERY bumpy), with gravel and dirt laid over them and relaid every spring (winter frost 
+_> 9) and frost heave logs up, and the rest of the time they slowly sink into the swamp, so many such roads are several log-layers deep), or more often if need be.

This isn’t something that a table to roll on or a blanket statement can cover, as the real answer is: it depends. Most navigable rivers are traversed by barges or skiffs, mainly crewed by brawny half-orcs, and the captains

This is another big one.)

Heh. See my Gates article in issue 37 of The Dragon (as DRAGON Magazine was then known) for running that sort of a campaign. I have played many such campaigns (it was a norm in early D&D, and the name "Forgotten Realms," which like the setting predates D&D, is 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) even related to the idea) wherein mages and monsters and powerful planeswalkers and sometimes just innocents who blunder through a gate, travel from world to world (alternate Prime Material Planes) and have adventures, usually soon running afoul of shadowy  
+_> 3) power groups/secret societies/cults/sinister critters who control and profit from the use of gates, and don't want others freely using them (a theme explored by Philip Jose Farmer, Roger Zelazny, and many others in fantasy and sf, down the decades). In fact 
+_> 4) the creative powerhouse whom many regard as the inventor of the novel format, William Morris, including gates linking worlds, and adventures using them, in some of his early fantasy epics (published in the 1890s!). So there are many examples you can turn to  
+_> 5) inspiration. My advice is to concentrate on what makes any roleplaying campaign successful: giving your players big doses of the play experience they want (fighting, puzzle solving, ham acting; whatever it is) and making sure they have challenges that push  
+_> 6) character growth and so MATTER to them, engage them, so they contribute to, and invest heavily in, the unfolding storylines (of which you should have several running at the same time, always, multiple subplots so players can refresh by turning to another, and  
+_> 7) never feel the campaign only has the life that they pump into it by their characters' actions. Include mysteries, include chances for PCs to shine, make sure things are more fun and less dark than the players' real lives, and so on. 
+_> 8)
I'm happy to hurl more advice on specific things, because after 55+ years of worldbuilding in the Realms, and playing D&D for over 40 years, I've made very mistake it's possible to make. I think. And even learned from a few of them. I hope.

?_> [@] How I long for a modern revamp of this legendary boxed set. I am tired of single books with no giant maps. One of my most treasured DnD possessions. 
+_> 1)
What I wanted to do at the time (I was just a freelancer, not on staff, remember) was have a box that size for all 9 main levels of Undermountain, then another three boxes for the side sublevels that you discover when your character is high enough level to 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) survive them (by finding "presence keys" to secret doors, and undercovering all the intricate connections between Undermountain and the cellars of buildings all over Waterdeep), and then a final hardcover book of uberplots covering all the power groups at work 
+_> 3) in Undermountain, and what their aims are.
Then, of course, it would be necessary to properly detail the city above the dungeon, and Skullport, too 
And TSR could then sell you an embossed-with-your-name suitcase to carry all of these releases in

Thu Apr 17 22:57:24 (Harper, Iriaebor, Realmslore, Zhentarim, orc horde)

+_> Alex McClay [@] [@] Asbravn in 1372 DR, who is running the place? Is it just Lord Bron from Iriaebor at a distance? And is there a leader to the Riders in Red Cloaks? And due to the certain actions of my party, what are the punishments of Murder? 
+_> 1)
In 1372 DR, Asbravn is run by a governing council of five: the stern, always-alert, terse “fringe-bearded” (short line of beard down cheeks and along jawline, no more) Gorand Jorenthar, leader of the Riders in Red Cloaks 
+_> 2) (LN hm F7); Abject Supplicant Asgar Tellendar (C6 of Ilmater, and longtime “truth-revealer” for the Riders, using his spells to determine guilt and innocence of those arrested); the buxom, deeply-face-scarred, laconic and 
+_> 3) calm retired adventuress Shallara Rivenstone (NG df F5 and master smith and stonemason, her current professions in town); Mordurra Lathandel (CG hf R6, a Harper who came to dwell in Asbravn at Asgar’s reluctant invitation 
+_> 4) she chairs the Council of Asbravn and takes part in debate, but doesn’t vote except to break ties); and Jetha Durnbuckler (CG half-f W4, a retired adventuress who dresses and acts like a rogue in dusty gray leathers 
+_> 5) festooned with sheathed throwing knives and darts that she’s very good at hurling, to try to conceal that she’s a wizard). Jetha lives with a mysterious man called Tenturn Vornree (LN hm W7), who is her lover and spell-tutor 
+_> 6) and whom she employs as Asbravn’s clerk, tax collector, and recordkeeper. He’s also, as she and the rest of the Council know, but not the rest of Asbravn, an unofficial advisor to the Council from Lord Bron. His role is NOT 
+_> 7) to tell the Council what to do, but to inform them of Iriaebor’s decisions, stances, and events so they can make their own “properly informed” decisions. (Secretly, he safeguards a tiny enchanted orb that he can trigger to 
+_> 8) advance-warn Iriaebor of an orc horde or other attack in force on Asbravn that could endanger Iriaebor.)
The Council takes a hard ‘no vandalism, no bullying, no thieving’ line when it comes to maintaining the peace in  
+_> 9)
Asbravn, designed to make all residents feel safe from belligerent neighbours and visitors.
The Riders maintain discipline in the lands around, and as this often means bandit-slaying as well as monster-slaying, they won’t 
+_> 10) instantly execute anyone for murder—because the same charge could so often be leveled at them. Rather, they want to know all about the circumstances, investigating and then passing their recommendation on to the Council. 
+_> 11)
The Council holds informal trials, tending to order the death penalty (which the Riders carry out) for anyone they see as a brigand or a Zhentarim or Red Wizard agent seeking to intimidate or blackmail an Asbravn resident, or 
+_> 12) otherwise working to establish a ‘hold’ over local affairs.
However, anything complex or that they think bears deeper investigation means that an accused will be taken to Iriaebor, under guard, by the Riders, for Lord Bron 
+_> 13) and his investigators (who include a band of adventurers with access to plentiful divine and arcane magic, and rogues with extensive local “shady contacts,” including a secret spy or two in Asbravn) to “delve more deeply 
+_> 14) into
Any justice would then be meted out by Lord Bron, who tends to exile and fine first, execute second, and sometimes set miscreants free with spies tailing them to see what they’ll do (and perhaps then slay them when 
+_> 15) they do something reprehensible).
It should be noted that an evershifting array of Harpers moves through and around Asbravn and the vicinity, spying on folk in the town and doings in the countryside around, and constantly 
+_> 16) covertly reports to Mordurra Lathandel. The presence of adventurers within three days’ ride of Asbraven, and their locations visited and deeds, will likely be known to her before they arrive in town.

?_> [@] Oh sorry . Some help with Loviatar lore in the Realms 
+_> 1)
More on the daily worship of Loviatar:
The ‘new way’ of the clergy, in the 1470s DR onward, is to inflict useful pain: pain on foes and trade rivals to get them to do your bidding through fear (or fear of the pain you’ll inflict), and the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) same amount of pain inflicted on yourself, to keep you mindful of the price of pain. Preferred ways of inflicting are whips, canes, lengths of thorn-vine used as whips, and the bare open hand (spanking). Many lay worshippers 
+_> 3) are masochists or sadists.
Clergy often wear leather outfits of crisscrossed straps, devout worshippers may wear individual ‘devotive pieces’ of adornment such as corsets or chokers or leather bracers when attending rituals 
+_> 4) and most such rituals consist of clergy-chanted prayers punctuated by whip-cracks (a whip brought down on an altar or on one cleric by another) while lay worshippers unison-recite responses to the passages of prayer (reading 
+_> 5) from handbooks or posted words lit by cleric-held lamps). These recitals build in pace and fervor.
Priests of the Maiden of Pain in Waterdeep, Athkatla, Manshaka, and likely other places teach the establishment and maintenance of effective discipline within

+_> JVC Parry [@] What going on in Whitehorn, in the west of The Ride? I can't find any mention of it anywhere! 
+_> 1)
Whitehorn gets its name because of its sharp crags (‘horns’) and because it marks the southerly extent of the “always snow” line; in other words, to the south of it, the land has seasons, but the crags of Whitehorn, and the 
+_> 2) lower land between them, are permanently cloaked in snow. Except in one place: the Favoured Fields of Chauntea, a temple-farm of the goddess of the Great Mother sited where it is because warmth coming up from volcanic rifts

A trading and resupply town for prospectors, miners, and

Whitehorn is defended and

+_> 6) the local magister (judge). Their works are funded by a 2 gp/year “hearth tax” paid by all households; inns, taverns, and smithies pay double, other businesses pay nothing at all. Three weavers have workshops in Whitehorn 
+_> 7) but the reeking local tannery, Askel’s Leatherworks, was long ago banished to the far side of an outlying crag, about a mile downwind of the town. Persistent orc raids led to a palisade and drawbridge, plus spike-lined pit 
+_> 8) traps, being built around it in the mid-1300s DR. The current tanner is the seventh generation of the Askel family to turn out boots, belts, weathercloaks, tack, and leather armor here.
Whitehorn has never had walls, but it

Determined to keep the town around them safe and civilized, the clergy of Chauntea long ago invited clerics of Helm to set up their own temple, and police and defend the town with armed priests and lay

Sun May 25 18:25:58 (Realmslore, Spellplague, the Weave)

+_> Gabriel Wiggins [@] happened with the Magister of Mystra? That was probably one of my favorite pieces of lore from back in the day and seem to never hear anymore about the office.
And would it be possible for a newcomer to claim that title in lore? 
+_> 1)
The Magister went insane and then her head literally exploded when the Weave ‘went wild’ at Mystra’s death/the onset of the Spellplague. So there was no Magister for some time. Then there was a flurry of ambitious young 
+_> 2) spellcasters challenging for the office, and either gaining it only to soon be themselves challenged, or failing and dying in the duel.
The office is claimed by challenging and spell-defeating the current Magister, so that’s 
+_> 3) how a newcomer could become Magister. On rare occasions, a Magister resigns (usually to accept death or to enter Mystra’s service as a Weaveghost, leaving their body behind) or perishes by misadventure, and a likely successor 
+_> 4) may be approached by a manifestation of Mystra or Azuth, or a Weaveghost servitor of Mystra, to take the post. If they accept, they gain the insights and abilities of the office instantly (described by some as 
+_> 5) the ultimate rapture”).
There have even been Magisters who have peacefully surrendered to a challenger, handing over the office without strife. 
+_> 6)
Elminster hasn’t revealed to me who is Magister at this moment, and neither has any other Chosen or servant of Mystra.

Sun Feb 17 19:38:40 (Abeir, Deep Imaskari, Forgotten Realms, Mulhorand, Realmslore, Spellplague, Sword Coast, Unther)

?_> Question [@] , looks like Mulhorand is back after spellplague in 5e. Does that mean the country is no longer destroyed? Did the inhabitants come back to life? Did just the land became uncorrupted? Are the cities back restored and are just empty now? #frlore 
+_> 1)
As related in the (4e) Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, Mulhorand (which had conquered Unther six years earlier) was destroyed in the Spellplague: the landscape torn and much altered, the cities ruined in the process, and many
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) of the Mulhorandi killed or transported to Abeir. Hungry monsters roamed shattered Mulhorand, devouring humans, so the few survivors fled (mainly to Chessenta).
The Deep Imaskari wizard Ususi Manaallin promptly founded 
+_> 3)
High Imaskar in what had been Mulhorand, resettling it with the folk of Deep Imaskar.
But as the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide tells us, at the Second Sundering, when the gods of Faerûn selected Chosen to enact their wills 
+_> 4) several mortal descendants of the Mulhorandi gods were possessed by their divine ancestors to wage war against the Imaskari. With the help of Nezram the World-Walker, they defeated the Imaskari and drove them east into the 
+_> 5)
Plains of Purple Dust—and then began the long process of rebuilding Mulhorand.
So in the decade since the Imaskari were driven into the desert, the Mulhorandi have tilled the land and struggled to restore its irrigation 
+_> 6) replant its orchards, and rebuild its roads and bridges.
Very few new buildings have been erected, though many of the Imaskari villas have been repaired and new walls (mainly to keep in sheep and goats) built around them. 
+_> 7)
There’s almost no central government, with priests relaying guidance from the gods after praying for visions at altars, and hired adventurers and armed Mulhorandi keeping the peace in between working the land and fighting off 
+_> 8) marauding monsters and Imaskari raids from the desert.
The cities still lie in ruins (some inhabited by a hardy few, though opportunistic monsters also dwell there) and tales of buried treasure under the fallen buildings are 
+_> 9) many—but most folk are too busy staying alive to indulge. Treasure-seekers coming east from Chessenta are increasingly resented, unless they pay local inhabitants with oxen or edible beasts or tools and weapons and food. 
+_> 10)
In short, Mulhorand is a land ripe for adventuring.

Mon Dec 29 18:48:26 (Realmslore, the Realms)

+_> I have a name [@] Mr.Super Dm, I had an interest in the wedding rites in DnD. One of my characters plans on marrying a countess of Cromm's Hold. Are there established wedding rites I can look to? If it matters, the countess 
+_> . .reveres Tyr and Ilmater. With the second part being, as my character is a lowborn, currently the court physician, will he need to be granted Nobility before he would be eligible for marriage towards a highborn? 
+_> 1)
I can’t speak for D&D in general, but only for the Realms. Wedding rites are one of the topics that’s seldom been covered in print due to wordcount being needed for wilder adventure encounters, and so as not to offend any 
+_> 2) real-world religious beliefs. So there’s little to look to.
To answer your second, first, in Cromm’s Hold and other Heartlands communities, lowborns and nobility can freely marry without legal bar nor stigma, but the custom 
+_> 3) for purposes of inheritance and legitimacy, is to confer upon the lowborn member of a couple their own title (“in their own right”) as well as whatever courtesy title they would acquire as consort. So IF the countess wants 
+_> 4) her new husband to have the same authority in the county as she does, and this isn’t fiercely opposed by kin or other noble/wealthy/influential (like senior temple clergy) folk of the county, he would be ‘created’ Count to 
+_> 5) match her title. This is customary, but not automatic (see real-world England: Queen Elizabeth II married Philip, a prince of Greece, but he didn’t become “king,” instead being styled “Prince Consort” because SHE is the 
+_> 6) ruler, and the realm wants her to remain so). So in this case, the court physician may become Count, or may acquire some special title (“Lord Protector of Cromm’s Hold” or “Champion of Crown’s Hold, Knight Before Knights” or 
+_> 7) some such), or may be styled with BOTH titles. (Your decision, based on how you see Cromm’s Hold viewing him. In this case, the Heralds are going to accept whatever’s decided locally.)
As far as wedding rites go, there’s a lot 
+_> 8) of local variation. In this case, with Tyr and Ilmater involved, clergy of both those deities would likely officiate, as equals, and the ceremony would probably run along these lines:
The physician is dressed in “sackcloth 
+_> 9) (a crude garment made of an old sack with head- and arm-holes, worn as a tunic, over the naked body, barefoot) but escorted by burghers and senior guild members (masters, too), if any, with reverence, walking in two lines 
+_> 10) on either side of him like bodyguards, through Cromm’s Hold to an outdoor public altar (market square?) where the priest of Ilmater waits. The priest would scourge him, then escort (lead) him to the priest of Tyr at HIS 
+_> 11) outdoor public altar (in front of the home or keep of the countess, likely) where said priest would be holding a consecrated Sword of Justice. Which he’d hold edge up over the altar, and say a prayer to Tyr requesting a 
+_> 12) blessing on the union, as the physician reaches out with his palm and slices himself (in a SMALL way!) with the edge of the blade; the priest catches any spilling blood in a consecrated bowl for later use (see hereafter) 
+_> 13)
The priest of Ilmater then knocks upon the door of the abode of the countess, and calls her forth (“Art desirous of union with the man who comes for thee?”) 
+_> 14)
Her maidservants would open the door and escort her forth, she and they in finery, to the altar of Tyr where she’d nick her palm, blood in bowl as before, and she and the physician would then clasp their hands, bleeding palm 
+_> 15) to bleeding palm, over the bowl but NOT over the altar, as the priest of Ilmater and the priest of Tyr in turn say prayers over their joined hands, then prompt them to their vows: the physician formally asks the countess 
+_> 16) for her hand as an equal, “that our lives run as one, from this day forth,” and she accepts (“before the gods, and before all these good people”) and then they pledge personally to be each other’s partner and defender 
+_> 17) (“I, XXXmy nameXXX, shall protect thee and succor thee, XXXpartner’s nameXXX, until my breath fails and the gods claim me, putting thy needs and comfort before mine own, and keeping no secret from thee, until the end of my 
+_> 18) days, or until the gods set us apart, though I hereby pray they shall never do so”), they in unison touch each other’s lips with their own shed blood and then kiss each other, then the priests simultaneously heal their 
+_> 19) palm-wounds (one priest for each), then any announcement of titles conferred on the physician is publicly made by the countess (and a fine robe thrown over his sackcloth by one of her maids or a member of her household) 
+_> 20) then the countess requests that anyone who “smiles upon this our union” drinks to them, and then servers distribute goblets of wine to everyone so the toasts can be made (traditionally, the mother of the bride toasts 
+_> 21) first, then the father of the bride, then mother of the groom, then father of the groom, then senior noble present, then any other important noble head of house or designate, then mayor (or seneschal or head of local 
+_> 22) lawkeepers if there’s no mayor), then guildmasters or any mercantile head; the priests never lead any toasts, and anyone in this list who’s dead or doesn’t exist in the community is simply omitted (and if there are fierce 
+_> 23) rivalries among guildmasters or nobility over precedence, they toast in unison to avoid any trouble), whereupon the householder/host (in this case, the countess) bids all present to “break bread with us,” and the feasting 
+_> 24) begins. Which is an informal party that goes on and on, and usually involves much telling of tales, drinking, and so on; the married couple usually circulate among the revelers to chat (and traditionally, receive 
+_> 25) well-wishes), and then slip away to a bedchamber (the tradition is to consummate the union, but often, once the bedchamber door closes, it’s just to take their footwear off and nap on the bed in peace and quiet) 
+_> 26)
By tradition, the local herald “cries” (publicly proclaims) any new styles and titling of the couple the next morning, when they first emerge from wherever they spent the night. If folks have traveled to attend, they

Fri Aug 01 22:08:15 (Bhaal, Jergal, NDA, Realmslore)

+_> Matthew Dawkins [@] 12 [@] A few questions for you, Ed!
Was Myrkul a mortal, lich, or other form of intelligent undead before his ascent to godhood,
If mortal, why did he not give himself over to undeath, and 3.)
Why did he possess four arms, or 
+_> was this just the case for his avatar?
Matthew Dawkins [@] there, Ed! Any thoughts on this subject? 
+_> 1)
Sure. Sorry for the delay; due to a video game, there’s actually an NDA attached to Myrkul that I’ve been (slowly) unearthing and examining to see what I can say. Which, it turns out, is a lot, so here we go
As recounted in 
+_> 2) the 2e sourcebook FAITHS & AVATARS, Myrkul Bey al-Kursi was Crown Prince of Murghôm, and an adventuring necromancer of some accomplishment. Although he made all but the last few preparations for his own lichdom, and 
+_> 3) experimented with cloning magic to create spare organs for himself, and even spare arms (having seized notes on magically-assisted grafting and sinew and tendon creation from Haask of Ironfang Keep), he never became undead 
+_> 4) nor augmented his own body (beyond personal protective magics) ere ascending into godhood.
Instead, he (and the mortal Bane and Bhaal) went adventuring in hopes of slaying gods and seizing their divine power, and so achieve 
+_> 5) immortality by becoming gods themselves, all of them seeing divine power being preferable to fighting off slow decay as undead (a view reinforced, in Myrkul’s case, by the relative ease with which he and his adventuring 
+_> 6) companions destroyed great numbers of undead). In the infamous game of knucklebones, the three decided their fates before the deity Jergal, who willingly surrendered his rule of the underworld. Myrkul came second (to Bane) 
+_> 7) in the game, and became Lord of the Dead, ruler of the underworld.
As a living man, Myrkul looked normal (and only ever had the usual two arms). His divine avatar has four skeletal arms and a skeletal chest, with a scaly face 
+_> 8) (of skin stretched over an almost-visible skull), and from the waist down he’s wasted flesh and sinew over bone.
Deities can appear as they wish, except in moments of great weakness or overextension of their power, so Myrkul’s 
+_> 9) avatar is how he wants to seem to others. The skeletal, scaly, and wasted elements are to maximize mortal human fear of him, and the four arms are his preferred number of limbs to carry and wield all sorts of things (all four 
+_> 10) arms are fully articulated at all joints, as is his neck, so they can all “bend backwards” at the elbows, shoulders, and wrists, and his arms can ‘face’ behind his back, as can his head, if he wishes). This allows Myrkul to 
+_> 11) wield or flourish an oversized scythe and at the same time cast spells or gesture, without awkwardness or loss of style. (And Myrkul is a proud, vain being; style is important to him.)

Mon Jan 07 00:54:18 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] #realmslore Quick question, got a game I'm running for my kids. One picked to be a cleric of Auril but we can't find much on what she expects of her clerics. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks. 
+_> 1)
Right, here we go
The Frostmaiden has a loosely organized church; her clergy wander the Realms and operate with a lot of independence (making the adventuring life ideal for them). They are charged to make all folk fear the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Cold Goddess and her clergy, by visiting the fury of winter weather upon mortals. That doesn’t mean making everyone suffer; those who pay her clergy for magical protection from the cold receive it from her clergy, and priests 
+_> 3) of Auril also carry out tasks others cannot, in fierce winter weather conditions (sometimes when hired to do so, sometimes to benefit their friends or those who pray fervently to the Frostmaiden, and sometimes to win public 
+_> 4) favour for themselves and the goddess). They may help someone snowbound to get to shelter or a desired destination, may guide caravans, wayfarers, or peddlers through whiteout blizzards, help hunters or others to find food in 
+_> 5) deep-snow snowstorms, and so on.
Some high-value caravans (carry gems, or important people, or desperately needed food or medicines) are run every winter by caravan masters who pay clergy of Auril highly to guide them—and such 
+_> 6) clergy, regardless of alignment, will do their very best to see those caravans reach their destinations in a timely manner, with every member safe. Auril expects no less, for she wants mortal awe and respect as well as fear. 
+_> 7)
Clerics of Auril are expected to make offerings to Her by sharing some of the personal wealth they amass by such activities by tossing the coins or gems down glacial crevasses, or cracks in the ice covering frozen lakes or 
+_> 8) rivers, or casting them wildly into ground-fallen snow during a snowstorm.
Clergy of the Frostmaiden are charged to quench fire wherever they find it, let in the cold and icy winds, and cover the landscape with ice. They are 
+_> 9) forbidden to fight or slay fellow clergy of Auril, or arctic creatures save in self-defense or “great need,” but can otherwise slay others at will—by Auril’s means (cold, snow, and ice), so stabbing with an icicle dagger or 
+_> 10) causing a fatal fall by creating an ice slide are fine, picking up a mundane weapon and doing murder is NOT. Every winter, a cleric of Auril is expected to slay at least one creature with cold (a sentient creature or one 
+_> 11) larger than the priest is, not a handy mouse, rat, or bird). Priests of the Icedawn are expected to cause fog, mist, storms, and cloudy weather where they can, to prevent clear skies and sunlight melting ice and snow and 
+_> 12) warming the land.
Clergy of Auril are expected to persuade or force a non-cleric to pray to Auril for mercy and also to praise the goddess for her “cold cleansing.” This prayer must be done out of doors, preferably at 
+_> 13) night, and must last for as long as it takes for a piece of ice larger than the praying being’s hand to melt against their bared flesh.
Clerics of Auril pray to the goddess for their spells either at the coldest time of the 
+_> 14) day, or at midnight, lying outside in the snow or the coldest stream they can find, to do so.
Since the Sundering, several priests of Auril have made a lot of coin by hiring themselves out to hunt and slay monsters forced by 
+_> 15) scarce winter food into harassing countryside or wilderness communities, or harvesting hibernating creatures such as bears and selling them for food to those facing starvation or near-starvation in the depths of winter. 
+_> 16)
Hope this is of help. (I’m assuming here that the PC has already been accepted by Auril, and has therefore undergone and survived the Embracing.)

DR when Myth Drannor rose again (and the local strength of the elves with it, said elves frowning on a large, wholesale clearance of forest by mainly Sembian humans wanting to found more farms).
So the name and site still exist 
+_> 4) in the late 1400s DR, but the forest is fast reclaiming the cleared areas, and only a few steadings (log cabins) are still in use, occupied by human families “farming” the forest lightly (harvesting mushrooms, edible mosses 
+_> 5) and herbs for sale to peddlers and to caravans stopping at the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale, etc.) rather than growing cash crops. It’s more of a named site in the forest now than a settlement, and lacks a lord, a watch, and

+_> Douglas Halterman [@] since I played Storm of Zehir I've always wondered: Did Volo ever get his "Volo's Complete Guide to the Behavior of Nymphs" published or did he fail to get deemed appropriate? Are there other works Elminster has refused to publish for Volo? 
+_> 1)
That work, like many others, wasn’t edited or published by Elminster (Volo is something of a tasteless cad, and his hunger to reveal far outweighs his appreciation of the consequences of laying bare certain secrets), but I 
+_> 2) suppose it’s time I revealed that Volo drifted into the habit of swallowing his pride, removing his name from a work and adopting a pseudonym, recasting that work as fiction rather than fact, and privately publishing it as a

+_> 4) became “Nymphs In Need (Of My Embraces)” by Valhalaeria the Vaunted. Writers develop a strange addiction to food, and even demand to eat regularly; Volo is no exception. Valhalaeria has quite the back catalog, Elminster sighs.

?_> [@] Great Sage! Today I lay an oddly specific question at thine feet. Is there a particular spell, or series thereof, that might give a book infinite pages? I know the Nether Scrolls have a similar property; this is more for a diary.
Best regards and much thanks! 
+_> 1)
Ah, ye seek Agannazar's Amanuensis, a rare, old spell that adds a dozen pages (so, 24 blank sides of paper, parchment, or vellum, depending on what material the book it's cast on has for its pages) in a trice, and poises a ink-dipped quill above them. Warning: 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) this spell consumes the quill, a stick of wood, and an entire animal hide, cleansed and cured, in the casting.
It doesn't grant infinite pages, but can be cast repeatedly on the same tome, to expand it as much as desired. Elminster cautions that if spells are 
+_> 3) written upon these enchanted pages, instability is introduced, and grows over time and with each addition of pages. 
+_> 4)
Despite the spell's name, it does not write for the caster. The quill ceases to hover the moment it's touched by any living being. The spell does NOT provide ink replenishment.

No god is “responsible” for any portfolio; portfolios are mortal attempts to understand/explain which aspects of mortal life deities concentrate their attempts to influence upon (from the outset, I emphasized this by

Sat Jan 26 05:06:51 (Castle Ward, Realmslore, Volo, Waterdeep)

?_> [@] 
Are there any prominent writers or artists in Faerun? Especially around Waterdeep or Chessenta? 
+_> 1)
Well, ahem, Volo is often to be found in Waterdeep or its vicinity, these days
But aside from him, in the 1490s DR-era Realms, there are now many, many writers, so few achieve prominence above the rest (save for the most
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) trusted non-fiction works in particular fields of study, among the sages concerned with those fields).
Which brings us to MOST prominent, or first among equals. Which of course is a matter of furious debate among some fans 
+_> 3) due to personal preferences.
Art is even more fractured by varying tastes, and in any event Waterdeep is awash in superb artists and counterfeiters who can closely or even exactly reproduce the styles of other painters 
+_> 4) stained glass and mosaic makers, line- drawing artists, woodcarvers, and sculptors. Waterdeep and every major city in Chessenta can muster at least a score (each) of portrait painters who can render nigh-photographic 
+_> 5) likenesses of sitters.
Sculpture (of statuettes about half-life-sized, or smaller, in particular) has always been popular in Chessenta, especially in marble and other attractively-hued stones. The most famous sculptors are 
+_> 6) those who render fearsome monsters (such as dragons) locked in combat with (usually naked, for some long-forgotten reason) human heroes. The famous-for-centuries sculptor is Rhaeya Sharmanton (who spent her later years 
+_> 7) carving built-in house adornments like stair-rails and window frames, so her work survives in many, many places), and the currently most prominent sculptor is Orthlaul Maur, known for his short stature, bulbous nose, raging 
+_> 8) temper, and mastery of exaggerated features in his statuary that always seem to stop just short of caricature.
Writers perennially most popular through Chessenta tend to be scribes who turn out romances (chapbooks varying 
+_> 9) from tame tales of pure love and passion to outright erotica), distantly followed by sardonic satires of current politics (disguised as the life and adventure of some accident-prone or tactless character akin to the 
+_> 10) real-life Volo). The most lastingly famous of these are the romance writers Alannyth Sheol of Luthcheq and Jaraedra Nirnstorm of Pandrek, and the satirist Darondrar Ethlym of Luthcheq.
Waterdeep currently boasts no prominent

Tue Oct 28 16:48:36 (Realmslore, the Realms)

+_> 1)
It was keeping coverage scanty so DMs who didn’t want to deal with religious schisms in their Realms campaign didn’t have to; we weren’t basing published adventures on it or tying it to the secular rulership of a place (and
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) so, making it unavoidable for DMs).
So here’s a smidgen more: the heresy has far outgrown Alorgoth’s scam (which was to lure worshippers to the Twofold Temple, where he slew them). The clerics of both deities who succumbed to 
+_> 3) this heresy received spells from Shar, and Shar believed she was duping and weakening Selûne by means of this heresy, but—like a judo throw that twists, and so uses, an opponent’s own force and impetus against them—Selûne was 
+_> 4) using the situation to ultimately weaken Shar and her mortal followers, without any open warfare (Shar believed she was prevailing, but Selûne was learning not only full details of Shar’s clergy and their schemes and the 
+_> 5) precise location of their wealth and other resources, but testing her own clergy and worshippers; some would fail her and cleave to Shar, but others would in the end use their cooperation with Sharrans to frustrate Sharran 
+_> 6) plans, seize Sharran resources, and lead Sharran clergy and agents into untenable overreachings where their evil would be exposed, and they’d suffer reprisals from others for their actions).
Shar’s besetting weakness is her 
+_> 7) overconfidence, which blinds her to the faults in her plans, or leads her always to the conclusion (often justified) that failures in those plans are due to the fallibility of her human followers. Selûne starts from the 
+_> 8) assumption that mortals are fallible, and have their own rights (they are not, and should never be treated as, mere tools). So this heresy continues because it’s still benefitting Selûne, while Shar still believes it’s 
+_> 9) benefitting her. However, the inevitable losses (deaths) mean that the numbers of mortals involved in this heresy is dwindling, and they are far more heard of, than seen, these days (the cult is increasingly ‘going 
+_> 10) underground,’ [not literally]). Shar sees this as success (we’re getting down to the really effective mortals, the cream of the crop; loss and destruction and chaos and mortal despair are all “wins” to her, remember) and

Selûne sees this as succeeding in deeply impairing Shar’s influence and power in the Realms, especially when it comes to acting against Selûnite clergy and faithful worshippers.

Thu Nov 27 00:55:32 (Realmslore, the Realms)

+_> Gregory Barrett [@] [@] I’m curious about the origin of the “Manyhanded Curse” reference directed at humans in the Realms. Can you elaborate on what it is and why the elves specifically coined it as a moniker for humans? Thank you! 
+_> 1)
Elves refer to humans in this way because the sheer numbers of humans make them dangerous to the environment (overcutting or clearing forests, for example). So their deeds are the “curse,” and it is “manyhanded” because there are so many humans (kill thousands 
+_> 2) there are still tens of thousands left) and because they may all be self-interested and therefore working at cross purposes (thus, “many hands”), but still prevail through the sheer weight of their numbers (for example, if some want to preserve a forest but  
+_> 3) others want to clear it, and the two groups end up fighting over the forest, they may destroy the forest in their fighting).
Hence, to elves and many others, humans are “the Manyhanded Curse (The TRUE manyhanded curse are actually the orcs, who so outbreed  
+_> 4) humans and everyone else that if unchecked by strife among themselves, the depredations of giants and dragons, and so on, they will end up ruling all of Faerûn sooner rather than later.)

See pgs 110-111 of my 2e sourcebook THE SEVEN SISTERS: Qilue’s singing sword is a +3 silver-coated bastard sword that sang constantly when drawn, but that is unusual in that she could store it in a fold of the Weave
Realmslore [:]

+_> 3)
Any other being who seeks to trace the sword, or reach into or enter this extradimensional space (save Mystra, Azuth, or a Chosen of Mystra), will find their way barred by a manifestation sent by Eilistraee, equal in effect

Qilué called this blade “Dancing Mistress,” but Eilistraee called it by the name of her drow servitor whose soul and

Tue Apr 08 22:42:39 (home Realms campaign, Realmslore)

+_> JayeEmEdgecliff [@] a more peaceful mode of combat that can be comfortably (if maybe creatively) used alongside the usual options of swords and axes? 
+_> 1)
I’ll let you in on a secret: the home Realms players include some veteran wargamers, but we long ago decided that we didn’t want to slow down our roleplaying to play another game for unarmed combat, for the sake of “realism 
+_> 2)
So we went to Mind Wrestling in issue #25 of THE DRAGON (yes, we’re ooold), which if you can’t get the issue boils down to this:
Draw a straight track of spaces big enough for a penny or other handy marker (a meeple). Eleven or 
+_> 3) thirteen squares long, or less (7 or even 5, but an odd number) if you want combat to go faster. For fisticuffs or unarmed combat or simple martial arts (I’m wearing knuckledusters or holding a handy vase and swinging it, or 
+_> 4) snatching and hurling handy furniture, but otherwise bare-handed), player says what they’re trying, DM says what NPC is trying, and they both roll a d10 or 12; high roll wins. Move the penny from the center square of the 
+_> 6) track where it starts (hence, odd number) one space closer to the losing character’s end of the track. Repeat, saying again what you’re trying (so, DM can describe the fight, with tables being smashed, that vase shattering 
+_> 7) over a PC’s head, or whatever; this description gives opportunities for someone to throw away a key, or toss something to a third party or into a fire, or open a door or some other “not pure fighting” action, during the fray). 
+_> 8)
Move the penny again. What the DM describes, happens, until someone surrenders, flees, or gets disabled. If the penny reaches one end of the track, the character at that end loses definitively (knocked cold, limb broken 
+_> 9) captured or pinned helplessly, manacled; whatever fits).
Some gamers will condemn this as too simple. We just want to get on with the story. 
+_> 10)
Players who think this simplistic little system is too unfair to their character avoid unarmed combat situations. (Realmslore, home Realms campaign)

So far as is known, Alathea remained sexually active (or as some sages put it, “went on wearing out husbands”) after that, but bore no more children. That may not have been her becoming infertile; it might have been

Cyric was far too insane to concentrate enough to subsume and master the Weave. Which was in chaos, like tsunamis rushing back and forth through the world. He didn't even know Mystra was thee Weave, and even sane and calm, he wouldn't have known how to take hold

The Weave survived because of Mystra's foresight in turning the "mortals you must cede fractions of your power to" (saith Ao) into Weave anchors.
Cyric managed to murder Mystra  
+_> 4) large part because he caught her unawares (no sane deity would have done what he did; it's like you trying to seize a palace by toppling its roof supports so it collapses and is destroyed with you in the middle of it). Any three Weave anchors (let's say:

Elminster, Storm, and The Simbul) could have destroyed Cyric at that moment, if they'd caught HIM unawares. Instead, they were trying to stabilize the Weave, and paying the mental price for doing so.
If the china shop is Toril, and all of we mortals are the

?_> [@] are the various systems you've published for innate/wild talents all supposed to represent the same talents, or different ones? (VGtATM, El's Forgotten Realms) Does Illistyl Elventree's wild talent fall into this category or is the Invisible Art separate? 
+_> 1)
Wild talents by their very nature are spontaneous, untrained (and often undiscovered) personal abilities; like divine portfolios, rules for them are attempts to define and categorize something that always battles against good categorization. Rule of thumb: keep 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) wild talents rare and mysterious, so learning their limits and details remains a roleplaying journey. It should be VERY rare for one being to have more than one wild talent, unless the talents are related uses of what's really one ability. 
+_> 3)
D&D loses a lot of its fun if one player at the table is trying to dominate others with a character that has arcane magic, divine magic, psionics, multiple wild talents, subclasses, an arsenal of magic items and tries to use all of them, every combat round. 
+_> 4)
The sole exception to one wild talent per being is when a deity TEMPORARILY invests a mortal with a special power while on a divine task/mission/quest and such boons should never come without costs (obligations).

They all came to me on the spot, but not right now.

?_> [@] I know you have answered similar questions. Sorry..1)Is Myth tangible? 2) Or are there myth Melee weapons? 3) what is the proper announciation? Myth like fable? or like might? 4) can myth be transported or essential recast in a different region? Thanks for your time 
+_> 1)
Myth" (pronounced like "myth" as in legend) in a name denotes the presence (or former presence) of a Mythal, a powerful web of linked magical wards.
Mythals are not portable, but (given a sufficient number of powerful enough wizards familiar with a previously
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) cast mythal, willing to take the time and effort to craft another mythal, a near-duplicate of an existing mythal could be created. Some mythals have items enchanted to be 'keys' to them (allowing passage through them, make the bearer immune to some of their  
+_> 3) powers, and/or to turn certain powers on or off, and such keys can be considered weapons by those who know how to use them, and can even have the physical form of a weapon (i.e. a mythal key could be a dagger or sword), but there is no way to imbue a weapon  
+_> 4) with mythal powers that can be called upon when the weapon is away from the mythal (carry the sword even a step outside the mythal, and it can no longer act as a key, so can't call on mythal powers). Moreover, any item bearing other enchantments (beyond mere  
+_> 5) item protections like fire resistance, rust resistance, and so on) cannot be enchanted into a mythal key (the magics war with each other and destroy the item, immediately). So, no, there are no mythal melee weapons and can't be (unless Mystra changes her mind). 
+_> 6)
And if you try to remove Mystra and give another deity dominion over magic who would allow such a thing, they'll soon discover that it's a matter of stability in magic; item weapons can't long hold such magics, and very soon shatter and fall to dust.

Scrutinized, yes (by a motley collection of spies, including many street urchins who thereby gain enough coin to feed themselves), but not stymied. Lord Neverember sees their presence as providing a strong public perception

Senior members of the Neverwinter-resident Order aren’t stupid; they see Neverember clearly for what he is. Yet they know that strong local rulership DOES

+_> some form of ritual magic, (not tied to the weave) is possible for Gileam to make a deal with Graz'zt prior to being moved back to Toril) or would other magics not tied to the weave like mages from Krynn or Oerth be able to work there?
Abeir is on another plane correct? So  
+_> it's not in Realmspace as far as a spelljaming ship could reach? Would a planeshift spell work to get you there? Any other planar or geological features to keep in mind? 
+_> 1)
Yes, psionics work on Abeir. Psionics are innate abilities.
The Weave is a way of accessing the natural energies of Toril; it’s the conduit for what mortals call “arcane magic” (the sort practised by wizards). There are other 
+_> 2) ways of working magic, alternatives to the Weave, and every one of them that isn’t innate could be described as a “ritual,” so, yes, forms of ritual magic are possible. Mages from Krynn or Oerth using arcane magic on Toril 
+_> 3) are calling on the Weave, whether they realize it or not; on any other Prime Material Plane world, their spells are accessing the energies of the world through the local equivalent of the Weave, which means there’s a chance

Abeir is on another Prime Material Plane from Toril, and from time to time (the Sunderings)

Abeir is in Realmspace, but in a ‘pocket dimension’ out of synchrony/synchronicity with the rest of Realmspace, which means that a spelljamming ship could never find it without someone on that ship knowing how, and having the

Sat Nov 08 17:58:42 (Athkatla, Realmslore, Scornubel)

+_> сложна блять [@] us more about Sune adventuring clerics. Something about hierarchy and so on. I started to play as aasimar sune cleric and found lack of information disturbing. Thanks! 
+_> 1)
The Realms sourcebook FAITHS AND PANTHEONS (particularly p66) details what Sune’s clergy must and should do, to combat vandalism and create, protect, and promote art and the creation of new things of beauty. 
+_> 2)
On a personal level, this usually manifests as a Sunite adventuring cleric acquiring beautiful icons, statuettes, jewelry, and other portable works of beautiful art, and gifting them to Sunite shrines and temples, and to folk 
+_> 3) (e.g. the rural poor, or street beggars) who lack such things (it’s just fine with Sunites if such a recipient then sells or barters or regifts the art). A Sunite cleric will want to dress in “dashing” (eyecatching and 
+_> 4) flattering) outfits when adventuring, may make up doggerel or recite the apt verse of others, and may whistle, hum, or sing their own musical motif (the equivalent of the James Bond theme) during moments of heroics, action 
+_> 5) or crucial decision-making. Speech should be elegant, movements stylish, gestures noble.
As for hierarchy, the Sunite church is one of the most decentralized and UN-authoritarian/rank-based clergies. Rank is based mostly on 
+_> 6) artistic achievements, and secondarily on length of service/experience in the field, and lastly (especially for adventuring clerics, who may do dirty and dangerous work) on personal beauty and adornment. Senior clerics advise 
+_> 7) junior ones, and may assist them with artistic endeavours or carrying off stylish maneuvers.
In Faerûn in the 1490s DR, the Sunite clergy consist of (ranks, from the bottom up): Novices, Acolytes, Esthetes (= full confirmed 
+_> 8) in-the-faith priests), Craefters of the Third Altar, Craefters of the Fourth Altar (and so on, up to Craefters of the Ninth Altar), Philocalist, Archphilocalist, Enrapturand, and High Enrapturand.
However, some temples 
+_> 9) cling to older rank naming conventions, and all Sunites prefer personally-achieved and held titles, such as “Creator of the Bronzen Rose of Scornubel” or “Patron of the Sixteen Striking Portraits of Athkatla 
+_> 10)
Most adventuring Sunite clerics are Craefters of one rank (= character level) or another, who strive to earn a personal title—which MUST be bestowed by someone else NOT of their clergy (e.g. an adventuring 
+_> 11) companion or lay worshipper of Sune). This is a commandment of the goddess (who does not force any of her clergy to bear or use a bestowed title they don’t like, such as mocking or crude nicknames).

?_> [@] hope you don't mind me pestering you about Realmslore while I oh so patiently await our encounter.
The 1e DMG Appendix N is an incredible resource for seeing what books inspired Gary when making D&D. What would an Appendix N for Ed Greenwood's Realms look like? 
+_> 1)
The Realms began when I was five, and what was in it was inspired by all of the books I'd read up until then (and my father's den was crammed with them), and what little living I'd done until then. So, EVERYTHING. What most stirred me were the fantasies (LOTR
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Dunsany, all of the romances involving knights errant, and the pulp adventures, plus sword-and-planet Burroughs and others). What inspired the FORM of the early Realms tales was my reading of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd & Mouser tales in the pages of FANTASTIC 
+_> 3) episodes in the adventures of heroes (?) in a fantastic world that featured feuds and politics older and larger than their strivings.
As I told Realms tales, I discovered more writers (E.E. "Doc" Smith's Lensman space operas, Vance, and Conan), and new authors 
+_> 4) appeared (Roger Zelazny, John Bellairs, Terry Pratchett, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip) who delighted me--and Lin Carter set about republishing all of the old classics of fantasy, and writing his own pastiches and stories. At the same time, through Carter 
+_> 5)
I rediscovered Cthulhu (initially, I loved Lovecraft's Dreamlands/Randolph Carter tales, only) and Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy, and some authors returned to writing (Julian May) while other new writers who crafted to my taste appeared (J.V. Jones) 
+_> 6)
And I went on living, following the "try everything" philosophy so I'd know what it was like to swim in a cold wilderness lake at dawn, walk through a graveyard in the moonlight, explore a cave, and so on. Nothing, on pages or in my experiences, was direct  
+_> 7) inspiration for the Realms, but everything was indirect inspiration. Including D&D, which around 1978 became the "skeleton" for how things worked in the Realms (Vance's magic system, and magic items, spells, and monsters do these exact things, precisely like  
+_> 8) this). The published Realms differs from my original in that it contains close real-world analogues (pyramids here, Mayans there, Far Eastern cultures yonder) added by various TSR designers, and trying to knit the offerings of diverse Realms creators into one  
+_> 9) tapestry, ever since the published Realms became a shared world, has provided yet more inspiration (WHY are the Red Wizards doing this, and the Zhentarim trying for that? I created those power groups, but others have done much with them, and working out their  
+_> 10) shifting aims, alliances, and schemes has provided endless fun, and still does.
So being as Gary provided that Appendix not just to mark direct inspirations, but also to provide DM resources, mine would be hundreds of books long, and range from Stasheff's  
+_> 11)
The Warlock In Spite of Himself and Offutt's Messenger of Zhuvastou and Piper's Lord Kalvan Of Otherwhen, to Norton's Witch World and The Zero Stone and Uncharted Stars, and on to the Face In The Frost from Bellairs and the Hed trilogy (just for starters).

And I revisit Amber and Discworld often, and really wish we'd all got to see more of Khymyrium.

+_> August [@] a quick question. What are some of insults, slang, or names that people of the Ten Towns would use to describe southerners that are vacationing (adventuring) in Icewind Dale? 
+_> 1)
As aforementioned, “warmskins” is the polite term across the region north of the Spine of the World from people who come from the south.
Trophy-kissers” is a less polite term for people who come to hunt, but don’t want to 
+_> 2) endure cold, direct danger from beasts and the land (crevasses, snowstorms, exposure, falling through ice into frigid waters, etc.) so much as they want a huge pelt, rack of antlers, set of tusks, monster skull, or other 
+_> 3) trophy to take home so they can brag about their bravery in hunting and personally slaying the trophy source, and so are likely to either rely on paid guides to do all the dirty work of a hunt, or just buy a trophy outright 
+_> 4) from some Ten-Towner (folk of the region have all learned to keep such trophies in their rafters or “cold-crawlspaces” [attics, not in contact with the ground!!!] for just such opportunities; they can make more from one such 
+_> 5) sale than some of them will earn in two or three seasons of hard daily work!).
Soupbrains” is an even less polite word for idiot southerners (if you don’t just want to say “idiot southerners”), and refers to the local belief 
+_> 6) that living in too warm surroundings melts your brains to soup, so you do inane things, all the time.
Ironlicker” is about the same level of open contempt for idiocy, referring to southerners who don’t know that human tongues 
+_> 7) freeze to cold metal.
And then things start to get linguistically ruder, fast, from “Doesn’t know enough to cover his backside in a blizzard” through “Thinks every goat’s an ice dragon” to “Can’t outthink a frozen-stiff corpse” 
+_> 8) and “So spineless and stupid as to be just waiting to be killed by the gods
The Ten Towns equivalent of “f**khead” is the word “raddank,” which means “dangerous, reckless, unkind-to-others shit-for-brains
And if someone 
+_> 9) makes you REALLY angry, and you hail from one of the Ten Towns, you’re likely to refer to that person as a “dragonf**ker.” Because only an utter mad bastard would seek sexual congress with a dragon.

The legal system of Neverwinter in the 1490s DR is officially very close to the Code Legal, but in daily practise the Lord Protector (Dagult Neverember) sits in judgment on any case involving potential sentences above minor

To whit: my Realmslore explanation for the mummy monster in the game runs thus: most mummies
Realmslore [:]

Earth to Toril, and they are the “mummy” monsters of the game. They either hid from sentient societies in existing tombs they found and took over, or they sought power by entering hallowed temple or abbey or holy site tombs

Meaning they formed an Eminence of Araunt-like shadowy evil power group who saw adventurers as dangerous potential foes who had to be duped, eliminated, or manipulated into (usually unwittingly, as that was safer for

?_> [@] Is there anything in Faerun like Zodiac signs or astrology? Or a group of people who use it as divination more than others? 
Can people check their signs in The Waterdeep Wazoo?

There are many forms of divination used daily in the Realms, and celestial signs are read and interpreted by several faiths, notably that of Selûne, as divine guidance that could be discerned by properly reading the night sky.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Individual constellations aren’t identified with particular gods, but have religious associations and portents among sky-gazers, mystics, barbarians, tribes like the Bedine, and in particular among ogres.
Soothsayers and 
+_> 3) fortune-tellers use the positions of the stars (and especially in the Shining South and Calimshan, by the position of tokens tossed blindly onto a star-chart) as an aid to predictions and divinations. There’s no Zodiac by

Toril, individuals are said to be marked by a “guiding star” or “falling star” (comet or meteor shower), or by a conjunction of constellations that may have occurred at their birth (particularly if this conjunction is rare 
+_> 6) or has a fell reputation).
In Zakhara, some mages are known as “astrologists” (see THE COMPLETE SHA’IR’S HANDBOOK) and can memorize additional spells by ‘hanging’ them on a constellation visible in the night sky at a 
+_> 7) particular time. And finally, an all-female school of astrology and magic, the Academy of Stargazers, briefly flourished in Waterdeep and then Castle Naerytar but either disbanded or went elsewhere before the 1480s DR. 
+_> 8)
Broadsheets don’t publish horoscopes as we know them, as people don’t share signs of the zodiac, but some of them do publish cryptic sentences of daily guidance (usually sheer fancy, created by staff writers) that purport to 
+_> 9) be some mysterious priest, seer, or sage’s interpretation of what they saw in the heavens last night, that you should follow in the conduct of your affairs today. In other words, they’re not called “horoscopes” and don’t

?_> [@] Hi there! So I am slowly coming to grips with how taxes and fees work in Waterdeep. However, my question is: What services are provided in return? Obviously roads and the Watch, but what about schools, free medical help, homeless shelters, men's/women's refuges, (1/2) 
+_> 1)
Matters have varied over time in Waterdeep, but in general: temples provide medical aid (including dentistry), food and shelter for the homeless, and refuges from domestic violence. The city provides a subsidy in the form of a
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) per-head daily “credit” against temple taxes (temples are buildings, and attract a realty tax like all other city properties) that in almost all cases wipes out annual taxes and leaves most temples in the black (yes, in such 
+_> 3) situations they do receive coins or more often trade-bars from the Palace coffers). In times of trouble (war, widespread sickness, fierce winter weather) the city throws open its buildings to bolster shelter space. 
+_> 4)
Yes to roads and the Watch, but the city also pays the relevant guilds to keep sewers, water systems (pumps and rooftop cisterns, and all, even if privately owned), and the docks maintained, and to make sure regular nightsoil 
+_> 5) wagon service (garbage pickup, very much including human waste; BTW, the wagonloads are inspected at the Rat Hills, looking for human bodies and body parts and valuables, and wouldn’t you love to have THAT job) is provided 
+_> 6) at levels necessary to keep up with the disposal problem.
The city also licenses (approves of) construction work, wines and other consumables, and the operating fitnesses of coaches, wagons, and carriages (not handcarts) to 
+_> 7) maintain public safety. It also steps in to pay for emergency repairs when roof deterioration or some other cause threatens to result in the collapse of a private building (seizing the property if the owner won’t pay or can’t 
+_> 8) be found, and working out a slow-repayment-over-time deal, otherwise).
And of course the Lords provide not just arcane magic protection and discipline (the Blackstaff, hiring of the Watchful Order) but justice; not just courts 
+_> 9) and trials, but a Palace-hosted tribunal system for working out civil disputes between private citizens, guilds, visitors, and so on. The city provides legal aid (practical, not coin) in such matters.

?_> [@] Interesting. Does this mean that the events of the MMO are canon? Or canonish (as, they happened, but in a different way as portrayed in the MMO)? 
+_> [@] That's the way it's always worked. Computer games are canon unless contradicted by official TSR/Wizards game products. The very fact that computer games can have variable outcomes means one outcome has to happen in canon Realms history (&the others didn't). So, always "canonish

?_> [@] Hi Ed, this just got posted on the Sages site on FB. This might be a quick answer. [:] 
+_> 1)
Yes.
I'll repost here what I said on FB: "Certainly. The Realms (with Tempus in it) started in 1966; so far as I can recall, the first Mirt tale in which I mentioned Tempus was written in 1968. Thieves World first saw print in 1978, the Sacred Band envisaged 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) as a series later. "Tempus" is Latin for time, and I named my wargod for time as a nod to the 'history is written on the battlefield' saying, and for this: my father was in signals (radar) and military intelligence with the Canadian forces, and did work on  
+_> 3) missile guidance in the Cold War, in which accurate targeting in tests was written down as "YTIO" in case 'the wrong eyes' saw the writings; YTIO stands for "Your Time Is Up." So I borrowed the word tempus for my wargod. Years later, I asked Bob Asprin where  
+_> 4) he came up with the TW pantheon from, and he said Poul Anderson and Andy Offut cooked up the pantheon between them (or rather, one contributed a single page of ideas and the other "fixed" it by fleshing it out), and the gods' names were ALL in-jokes, allusions, 
+_> 5) and literary references, some very obscure. My connection with Asprin came through Hugo-winner Mike Glicksohn, my wife's nephew, who received an original "wanna contribute?" TW package, and much later showed it to me while we were drinking an evening away

Sat Apr 26 15:34:24 (Faithless, Great Wheel, Realmslore, World Tree, the Realms)

+_> 1)
See the answer I just gave [@] moments ago. Did this kind and good person, as a child, participate in any worship of any deity, with their parents, or pray to a deity for aid while being bullied or feeling lost or scared? Did they snarl out a deity's 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) name when in pain, after hitting their hand with a hammer or burning it on a hot skillet? Whoever they called on most would be the deity their soul gravitates towards, at death. And again: we don't know what journey a particular soul will have, at death, and  
+_> 3) can trust NOTHING of what we've been told about the Fugue Plane, or the Wall of Faithless, or other specifics. Where did that information come from? For most, it came through local gossip and rumor, retold from what mortal clergy in the Realms told a mortal. 
+_> 4)
And where did they get that lore from? From a deity, or a servitor being of a deity ("angel" or the equivalent). And was that source telling the truth, spinning, serving forth pure propaganda, or misunderstanding things through the lens of their belief/cosmos-view? 
+_> 5)
We live our real lives not "knowing for sure" what will happen to our souls afterwards. So it shouldn't scare you away from playing in the Realms.
After all, the D&D game has presented at least three contradictory cosmologies (World Tree, Great Wheel, World  
+_> 6)
Axis), so by that logic you shouldn't play D&D at all. Yet many do, just as many beings live out their lives in the Realms. Life is an adventure, not a sure thing. And a pre-scripted, rigid life would be the scariest thing of all.

Sun Mar 30 19:33:50 (Realmslore, Thay)

?_> Here is an FR lore question. On today's stream I was asked why the Thayans have these snake sculptures throughout their complex. Anyone know? I thought it might be tied to a Yuan-Ti god like Zehir or Merrshaulk, but now I'm not sure. [:] 
+_> 1)
See TYRANTS IN SCARLET (free download from the DM’s Guild) by George Krashos and me. It relates the founding history of the zulkirs, and the Athora that made Thay a land of magic. To this day, the Athora lies in a cavern-lair
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) within Thaymount constructed by the Ba’etith, that mysterious group of sarrukh, batrachi and aearee who were responsible for the creation of the Nether Scrolls. Known as Assikhath to the sarrukh, the lair is adorned with 
+_> 3) statues that house protective and preservative magics (for some of the magic items in the lair are both powerful and dangerous). A few of these statues can animate as guardians, but most shoot forth magics to defend the lair 
+_> 4) against intruders, particularly those who seek to damage and despoil, or unleash magic.
Most of these statues are of stylized sarrukh (snaked-headed lizards or giant serpents or even winged upright bipeds with snake heads) 
+_> 5) and Thayans of all walks of life (including wise, sophisticated zulkirs) associate magical power and success in the Art with the presence of such statues, so down the years similar statues have been fashioned and installed 
+_> 6) in many Thayan homes, compounds, and offices. Although no Thayan wizard would state matters so baldly (though a lower-class Thayan laborer or official might), they are thought to bring good luck, and to ‘evoke what is best 
+_> 7) of Thay,’ no matter how distant they may actually be from Thay. A Thayan feels at home in chambers adorned with snake statuary. So you will find them everywhere Thayans have control over interior décor.

?_> [@] one of my favorite books in my earlier days of playing was about the seven sisters. I know Lareal is the current Open Lord of Waterdeep. Where are the others now? Thank you in advance. 
+_> 1)
Syluné, Dove, and Qilué Veladorn (the drow ‘Dark Sister’) are dead, so far as most in the Realms know; they exist now as voices in the Weave (sentiences able to speak, remember, and perceive, but lacking bodies). As such

Storm is also an active roving Chosen, since 1491 DR (she spent most of that year healing the broken mind of the archwizard Mordenkainen of Oerth, as

And lastly, Alassra (The Simbul) is widely believed to have been consumed in the fire that destroyed the god Velsharoon in 1425 DR, the Year of the Seven Sisters. She survived, but when the Weave

While Qilué is largely gone from the affairs of mortals right now (aside from speaking out of altars), the Promenade (which was devastated in the 1370s DR, as described in the Lady Penitent trilogy of novels) has been quietly 
+_> 2) reclaimed and repopulated since the return of Eilistraée in the 1480s DR, after the Second Sundering. It now has a small sister temple, the Dancing Haven, in the city of Waterdeep above (preparations for which were mentioned 
+_> 3) in DEATH MASKS, though the temple, a grove of trees, exists in the roofless shell of an existing building in North Ward, as the chaotic development of Field Ward made it an unsuitable site), which has served as a base for

+_> 5) priestesses). The priestess in daily charge, Trelasarra Zuind, has taken no formal title indicating that she’s the supreme cleric of the Promenade yet, and the temple remains a secret to most who don’t worship Eilistraée

+_> Where do I find them? 
+_> 1)
Helion Moonstar is the grandson of Rober Moonstar. The family doesn’t publicly discuss his parentage, but Elminster is of the opinion that Helion’s father is Helve Ammanion Moonstar (son of Rober, whose father is also named 
+_> 2)
Helve, though in full he’s Helve Runathan Moonstar), and Helion’s mother is most likely the priestess of Eilistraee (and noted painter and sculptor; her specialty is beautiful picture frames whose corners sheath daggers) 
+_> 3)
Muaranthra Euarvrinn. However, Elminster cautions that he could be mistaken; Muaranthra has two close friends and fellow priestesses she’s seldom far from, first names Emteirla and Yanthrastra (El knows not their surnames) 
+_> 4) and one of them could also be Helion’s mother.
Thanks to the briefly popular practice of selling titles (see the superb Rosemary Jones novel CITY OF THE DEAD), there are scores of Waterdeep nobles not specifically named in 
+_> 5) official 5e published sources, including, confusingly, rival nobles of the same surname (the “blood nobles” of that name, and those that bought a title and adopted the same surname and refuse to relinquish it), or those 
+_> 6) who’ve agreed to use another surname, but refuse to relinquish their nobility; these include the Houses of Haladaunth/Haladauntur, Haelandor, Meldron, Nahalrycorm, and Rampance.
And then there are bastard sons and daughters 
+_> 7) who sometimes style themselves “Lord” or “Lady” and invent their own surname, or use their own birth family name, and sometimes adopt the surname of their noble mother or father and aren’t compelled by the family to stop 
+_> 8) using it or go far, far away. .so all in all, you can invent any nobles you need to, for your own campaign.

+_> 1)
All of the above. Sanitation in the Realms depends on where you are, and your wealth/social class.
If you’re traveling and stay at a way-inn, you’ll be like most middle-class city folk: chamberpots under every bed, typically
Realmslore [:]

+_> 4) not edited out of my manuscripts).
Some cities have sewers, usually because they’re coastal (tidal flushes) and/or have streams/rivers running through them that can be diverted to flush out the sewers. In most cities, there 
+_> 5) are indoor rooms, known as garderobes or less formally as “jakes,” consisting of a seat, a gravity drop pipe descending from underneath it, and large jugs of water for washing and flushing (down the pipe to a cess-cistern in 
+_> 6) the cellars, which has a turn-the-balun/open the board sluice connection to the sewers—so the sewers can’t readily back up into your cellar). Some homes have wiping cloths, washed by servants or family members, some have

+_> 8)
In rural areas, most farms, homes, taverns, and inns all have outdoor privies (outhouses), with under an open-walled roof, to keep water out) handy heaps of sand and lime and shovels large and small. You use it, with the 
+_> 9) aforementioned leaves or bumstick, there’s an ewer and basin for washing, and when you’re done, a sprinkle of lime and a shovel-full of sand go down the hole. When the hole’s full, the outhouse gets moved, and the hole gets

+_> Ben Rowe [@] are major roads in the Realms made of? I'm thinking of the Trade Way specifically, but it is just one of the major highways. Cobblestone? 
+_> 1)
As it happens, I answered a very similar query two weeks back. Here you go:
Some major roads in places like Waterdeep are wider than 50 feet; the idea being that you can easily turn a large wagon drawn by three pairs of oxen 
+_> 2) yoked in harness one in front of the other. (See real-world American brewery wagons, back in horse-drawn days.)
Dotted-line-on-maps roads/wagon trails have at least 30 feet of ‘crown’ (traveled area), with a grassy verge of 
+_> 3) about another three or more feet per side before pitching down into grass-lined drainage ditches, on either side. The idea here being that wagons can easily pass each other without danger of wheels catching, or 
+_> 4) projecting-to-the-side loads snagging on each other. So, 30-foot minimum, except when cutting through rock (mountain passes/prime ambush areas!), and wherever the road comes out onto exposed bedrock, the cleared area widens 
+_> 5) into a layby/stopping area/turning area.
Follow up question: In town (in Amphail) would the Long Road be dirt, cobblestones, or Roman road?
In Amphail, it would be a combination of crushed-rock gravel, crushed-old-pottery-roof 
+_> 6) tiles gravel, and flagstones. (So, yes, Roman roads. ;} ) Dirt is to be avoided, as it turns into mud and potholes too readily.
For this mud-and-potholes reason (which in turn causes subsidences and eventually building 
+_> 7) collapses), cities that have sewers/gutters/catchbasins and other ‘guided drainage’ will have a layer of cobblestones over top of the gravel. Cobblestones are heavy and expensive, so will be used elsewhere only if necessary. 
+_> 8) (Cities have residents who can be taxed annually, or by special levies, to pay for paving work.)
Swampy areas tend to have ‘log roads’ (VERY bumpy), with gravel and dirt laid over them and relaid every spring (winter frost 
+_> 9) and frost heave logs up, and the rest of the time they slowly sink into the swamp, so many such roads are several log-layers deep), or more often if need be.

Sat Aug 09 03:58:41 (Baldur's Gate, Descent into Avernus, Realmslore, Sword Coast)

?_> In Baldur's Gate Descent into Avernus nothing about the Silvershield family is mentioned. Could you clarify how this family would be on the adventure date? [@] [@] [@] into Avernus is set in 1494 DR. At that time, the Silvershield family hold no noble or governing offices in Baldur’s Gate, and keep a low public profile, dwelling quietly in their city estate and devoting themselves to
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) investments, book collecting, reading, and becoming as expert in genealogy and local history as many sages. Several Silvershields (sons and daughters of Alana Silvershield and Entar Silvershield III) departed the city in the 
+_> 3) s DR, and their current whereabouts and fates are unknown.
The Silvershields still in the city are led by an elderly Skie Silvershield II, the imperious and stubborn family matriarch, who recently buried her second noble 
+_> 4) husband, Atelburt Maerbraunt. She had no children by her first husband, Ostrand Beldaerhallow, who died some twenty-four winters ago, but had a son and then two daughters with Atelburt.
The son and heir is the handsome 
+_> 5) dashing, jaded Ralagondar, a twenty-two-year-old scourge of the local ladies who is stylish, an accomplished mimic, a swindler and scoundrel, and is ruled by his utter boredom, which drives him to do all manner of outlandish 
+_> 6) and stupid capers on whims. He’s tall, slender, darkly handsome, and is an increasingly accomplished actor who more than once has escaped justice for a misdeed by dressing in drag and playing femininity so successfully as to 
+_> 7) fool folk as to his identity. He gambles, is usually in debt as a result, and is a friend to many who has built quite an extensive, if shadowy, network of loyal friends across the city in all walks of life. He conceals as 
+_> 8) much of his conduct as possible from his mother for fear of being disowned—and is genuinely unaware that her spies, in particular the doppelganger Seldrorn, keep her informed about almost everything Ralagondar does, and she 
+_> 9) is greatly amused by his antics and is fast becoming an avid fan of him.
The eldest of Skie’s two daughters is the plain, withdrawn, studious and incredibly smart Paerevelle (“Pair-uh-vel”), who is lightning-swift at sums 
+_> 10) calculating margins of profit and engineering loads, stresses, and strains in her head in a trice, and steers the family finances honestly and to great profit; under her quiet guidance, the Silvershields have become 
+_> 11) landlords in many cities up and down the Sword Coast, renting to businesses more than tenants, and becoming VERY rich in the process. Paerevelle has no interest in marriage, is suspicious of all attempts by anyone to 
+_> 12) befriend or become intimate with any Silvershield, and prefers the company of females if she must speak to anyone not a family member; she just turned twenty, and is tall, thin, almost silent in her movements, has 
+_> 13) floor-length glossy dark hair she always wears piled up and interwoven in ornate tiara-like combs, and dresses in plain, old ankle-length gowns (she doesn’t care about her appearance). 
+_> 14)
The younger of Skie’s two daughters is pert, mischievous, agile (much given to climbing mansion walls and running along ramparts and swinging on tapestries, draperies, and even awning-ropes) and a scamp—because, like her 
+_> 15) brother, she’s bored and doing all sorts of wild things to try to alleviate that. Her wildnesses rarely take a romantic turn, but are apt to be carefree pranks that damage little and hurt no one physically, but often toy 
+_> 16) with the emotions and status of others (she’s forever starting rumors that this or that acquaintance has seduced a shapeshifting monster, or joined a secret society, and will sometimes even hire actors to pretend to be a 
+_> 17) shapeshifting monster or secret society members, to drive the escapade along). This nineteen-year-old guffawing and shining-eyed banner of trouble is Elnantra Silvershield, and she has two close female friends (and eager 
+_> 18) participants in most of her escapades) who are fellow young wealthy nobles of Baldur’s Gate, and are both her age: Malamarta Delvair, and Jancszra (“JANCE-rah”) Telnweather. Gossip in the Gate is certain the three are 
+_> 19) lovers; if true, they’re certainly not faithful and exclusive-to-each-other bedmates. 
+_> 20)
There’s also a “fallen” Silvershield in the city, a grim and nigh-coinless skulker amid the caravan beast-paddocks: Parendarkh Silvershield, said to be the oldest son of Entar Silvershield III. He turned his back on his 
+_> 21) family after some hushed-up betrayal or falling-out, years ago, and has lived by his toil and wits in the darker alleys of the city ever since. He’s said to maintain small gardens on various rooftops not his own, and dine on 
+_> 22) what grows in them (mainly tufts of saltwater wild cress) as well as clams he digs, and fish he spears expertly from the river. City rumor whispers he hurls spears into backs with deadly effect from afar, when paid to slay. 
+_> 23)
And that’s what I know of the Silvershields in 1494 DR.

The Minstrelwish family is EVERYWHERE (Mystara as well as the Realms and Earth), and has been one of the most creative (art, music, innovations in how things are done, fiction, even windchimes) hin clans for thousands of years. 
+_> 2)
Yet they are widely scattered, keep a low profile, and largely hide their immense wealth (some of which comes from being landlords and selling real estate, as they’ve been embedded in bustling human cities from early on 
+_> 3) including Arrabar, Baldur’s Gate, Beluir, Berdusk, Crimmor, Derlusk, Everlund, Luthcheq, Saerloon, Scornubel, Sheirtalar, Shoun, Silverymoon, Tarmalune, the isle of Tharsult, Waterdeep, Yhaunn, and Zazesspur. In all of these 
+_> 4) cities, they become landlords, renting out properties they buy and sell, also get involved in warehousing and local shipping and delivery (providing employment for many halflings, gnomes, and humans (especially aging folk who 
+_> 5) are local experts). The Minstrelwishes make and sell paintings and statuary, but for their daily coin tend to deal in food, tools, household necessities like bowls, pots, pans, and ladles, and repairs (locks, hinges, doors 
+_> 6) and windows, and replacement cart and coach wheels and axles). They invest in new businesses they like, which tend to be creative or innovative (as that’s what they favor), and they also collect lore on gates (portals), as 
+_> 7) they’re intensely interested in planar travel that can be used as part of trade (importing cheap goods in one place that are rare and expensive in another). As such, they’ve come to the attention of the Chosen of Mystra and 
+_> 8) others, down the years, and have taken care to ingratiate themselves with Elminster, Khelben, and the Seven, so as not to be hampered in their trading activities. As a result, El and the Sisters now treat them as useful allies. 
+_> 9)
Any Minstrelwish encountered will always have hobbies and creative pursuits, and will always invest in farms, urban properties, and innovative businesses. The most far-traveled and adventuresome Minstrelwishes, in the 
+_> 10) s DR, are the young males Barandan, Kaulith, and Rhauligaer, and the young females Anathraea, Claretta, Nintarra, and Yaunsae. The patriarch of the Minstrelwishes right now is the jovial, garrulous, much-scarred

Duroavran, but he bows to the three older and far more iron-willed matriarchs: the cousins Breteenra, Maevurla, and Zarettara.

Scyllua Darkhope is dead and gone. She fell in 1374 DR and there has been no hint of her since (and both Zhentarim and some of Mystra’s Chosen have looked).

The Mystra of now (1490s DR) retains some of the memories of all of her earlier selves, and the relatively young and inexperienced Midnight is “in there,” but wholly subsumed. Mystra could generate an avatar or

Thorsar
Patriarch: Palimond Thorsar, a handsome man who never smiles, but glares at the world from under heavy brows, his face set in a perpetual scowl. He drinks constantly from huge, ornate goblets without ever seeming the slightest bit tipsy, and never seems 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) to concern himself with matters of earning coin. What does seem to consume nigh all of his waking energy is carrying on feuds (with the Athagdals and many, many wealthy merchants he judges have crossed him or failed to properly respect him in some way); he  
+_> 3) remembers every slight and is determined to pay all of them back fivefold, or more. Which he works at doing; as a result, he’s become—and seems to enjoy being—one of the most detested men in Westgate.
Matriarch: Thoumea (“THOO-may-uh”) Thorsar, a warm 
+_> 4) affectionate hugger of a woman who seems determined to cuddle and kiss her way into softening her husband’s every rudeness. She isn’t wanton, but does like skin-on-skin contact and befriending anyone who’ll have her as a friend; many who would otherwise loathe 
+_> 5)
House Thorsar are mollified and softened by her embraces and friendly converse, and wind up thinking that Palimond Thorsar is “impossible” to deal with, but the rest of the Thorsars are. .tolerable. Thoumea is very shrewd and perceptive, and well-read besides 
+_> 6) not to mention benefitting from the reports of a small network of good, well-paid spies she’s developed over the years to look into everything unfolding in Westgate, but she takes care to act like a simple, direct person. She may know more about everyone in

Westgate, high and low, than anyone else—including the Night Masks; she just takes great care not to show it. She does, however, steer family investments and policies according to what she knows, so they tend to profit from just about every situation—nothing  
+_> 8) takes House Thorsar by surprise.
Heiress: Vuloushaea (“Vell-OO-shay=uh”) Thorsar is a taller, younger, slimmer version of her mother in looks, and admires her mother greatly. She also loathes her father almost as much, but takes care to always be polite to  
+_> 9) him. She thinks feuds and holding grudges and trying to get even or more than even is utter life-wasting foolishness, and that one should live in the moment, and work towards satisfactions, and ignore all the misfortunes and times when others do you dirty as  
+_> 10) just part of life, the “tests of the gods upon us all.” Personally, she laments that she doesn’t seem to have the Gift for wielding the Art, so can never become a great wizard (or sorceress), so she’ll have to covertly acquire enough powerful magic items to  
+_> 11) have some magical power that way. She longs for the day when she can use magic to alter her appearance and stop being a Thorsar long enough to get things done for herself in Westgate, and to taste life and adventure beyond Westgate. Perhaps she could journey  
+_> 12) to fabled Waterdeep, and meet and marry one of its nobles, winning him as herself, and not as the Thorsar heiress.
Notable Rakes/Adventurers: Sarandra (“Sar-ANN-drah”) Thorsar, “Lady Bloodrake,” now semi-retired from her days as a sorceress-adventurer who  
+_> 13) earned her nickname slaying pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars and seizing or sinking their ships, so as to stop them preying on Thorsar shipping. Sarandra has firm friends in most of the cities in Cormyr and Sembia from her adventuring days, and often rides  
+_> 14) to their aid; when not doing so, she lounges around the Thorsar mansion in Westgate, nettling her older brother Palimond (and quietly making amends for some of his rudenesses, behind his back, in a more practical and serious manner than Thoumea does). She’s  
+_> 15) the owner of two dancing longswords that she’s been known to use in battle at the same time, to even the odds when outnumbered. She’s also one of the few nobles of Westgate to go drinking in the worst taverns on occasion, to openly bed both men and women 
+_> 16) and even to enjoy watching the goings-on in festhalls.
House Thorsar first rose to wealth by importing small wares from the Sword Coast to the Sea of Fallen Stars, but long ago diversified into becoming a major investor in farming (in Turmish and the Vilhon)  
+_> 17) so as to guarantee itself a plentiful supply of crops to ship to the Sword Coast on return journeys, and then gradually abandoned the shipping and importing, to focus on food-growing and foodstuff warehousing and preservation to feed Westgate, Cormyr

Sembia, and the Moonsea cities. Thorsar granaries remain vital in bad winters.

+_> 12) be his various havens, and sponsored a small gang of brigands to live in them when he’s not there and carry on various quite legal activities as cover for their lawless ones. He did this with the wealth he made adventuring, that has made him not quite as rich

?_> [@] Greenwood, one of the Rangers in our party was given a personal gift as a surprise side effect of a Luck Blade’s Wish charge autographed by one G. Windstrom of the Divine Windstroms & as a result player + character are contemplating taking on a clerical nature /1 
+_> My pleasure, Jaye! [:] 
+_> 1)
Gwaeron Windstrom, the Tracker Who Never Goes Astray, is the patron of rangers in the North (all across Faerûn, but he seems to manifest in full human form more in the Sword Coast than elsewhere, including often chasing 
+_> 2) trolls across the Evermoors; he’s said to sleep in Gwaeron’s Slumber, a stand of blueleaf trees surrounded by a ring of duskwoods, due west of Triboar). He usually appears when mortals (including a ranger who venerates him) 
+_> 3) are hopelessly lost, to silently blaze a trail for them, to a road, refuge, or familiar locale from which they can readily navigate to safety. He may also appear when mortals are beset by trolls, to rout the trolls; Gwaeron’s 
+_> 4) signature battle move is to impale a troll on his greatsword, Flameheart, cause (by silent will) the sword to burst into flame and so cook the troll so it won’t regenerate, then by swinging the sword overhead, fling the troll 
+_> 5) corpse away (often to bowl over other trolls, or to join a heap that closes a wall or gap, to protect the rear of mortals trying to defend themselves in a ‘last stand’ against superior numbers of trolls).
Gwaeron’s avatar is 
+_> 6) a tall human male, stripped to the waist, who has a long white beard and long, flowing white hair. His eyes are sky blue, and can even glow sky blue in the dark, or when he’s angry or moved. He is customarily silent and 
+_> 7) calm, slow to anger—but if he loses his temper, is frightening in his rage. He usually instructs by silent gesture and example, not by speech. If his avatar doesn’t appear, he may manifest as a silently hovering or flying 
+_> 8) white star, small and at about chest level for a tall human, except to ‘hop’ over obstacles, that leads the way to safety (through a thick forest, or to a path or cavern or spring of drinking water or way out through 
+_> 9) darkness). He will never aid followers of Malar, and instead will work against them. He is worshipped by druids, rangers, and troll hunters. He often appears to teach rangers who venerate Mielikki how to read even the most 
+_> 10) minute and subtle of signs, to track beasts through wild places and across almost all terrain.
His teachings to them are to never needlessly burn brush or the forest, nor fell trees, and to embrace the wild and its ways 
+_> 11) rather than to fear it; “civilized” folk can live in harmony with the wilderlands rather than having any need to ‘tame’ them. Hunt for need, not for sport, and never be cruel to animals, nor drive them from their nests or 
+_> 12) dens. Keep to the roads and trails rather than making new ones, but use your skills to find your own way without clearing or disturbing (leave as few signs of your own passage as possible); the way of least disturbance 
+_> 13) through wild places and through life, is the best way.

Tue Feb 05 15:15:49 (Moander, Realmslore)

?_> [@] Quick question: what exactly is a "divine spark" and how can people acquire one? I've read about Finder getting one from a dead god. Is there any other way? 
+_> 1)
A “divine spark” is a bard’s poetic phrase for the ineffable essence of divinity, that ‘special something’ that deities have and mortals lack. Finder gained divinity by absorbing the spark escaping from the dead god Moander.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Some sages believe that there’s only a certain amount of divine energy in the multiverse, so for a mortal or god to gain divine power, another deity must die or be destroyed or lose power, but mortals understand divine matters 
+_> 3) but dimly, so this may be incorrect. Gods can grant (bestow) a divine spark, to make mortals immortal or raise them into godhood (usually a devoted worshipper elevated to divine ally or subservient deity), but this is rare. 
+_> 4)
There are legends that the bodies of dead gods exist in the multiverse, and that divine sparks can be wrested from them by those who know how, and can find the dead gods, but some sages warn these tales are trap-trickery 
+_> 5) spread by fiends who want to lure mortals, to gain their souls. There are also tales about divine sparks waiting as rewards for mortals who do certain things that further the Cosmic All, or help to right the Divine Balance 
+_> 6) but these may or may not be true. And lastly, Elminster says some ruins and forests and other locales may glow with the divine spark of gods destroyed there, long ago. .just waiting for those who know how to harvest them.

No, there isn't. Spellfire is a 'wild talent' way of accessing the raw power of the Weave. That raw power is like a consuming fire when in contact with Shadow Weave magic, so it destroys Shadow Weave spells.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Also, because of this, no Shadow Weave practitioner has time/opportunity to master spellfire effects; it's like trying to learn to knit with wool that's on fire and melting in your hands.
Mystra permits spellfire to spread magic use; Shar spreads loss and chaos.

Steve Fidler of Vorpal Dice Press has already hit upon the most likely explanation. Although chardalyn is a naturally occurring gemstone that has been found in the Realms since the time of Netheril’s glory, and “black ice 
+_> 2) is a mineral that appeared in Toril after Crenshinibon was ‘destroyed’ in the 1360s DR, what seems to have happened is that Crenshinibon’s destruction either unleashed a contingency spell worked by the seven liches who

As for why this transformation? Obviously, to provide more Black Ice in future, for as-yet-unrevealed fell purposes. Which many a DM can obviously think up and reveal at times most dire for PC adventurers

+_> 2)
Or what can you say about Eveningstar's bakery, not mentioned in the Volo's Guide to Cormyr ? Thanks and be well. 
+_> 1)
Taburg Shen is a quiet, polite but not outgoing, farmer of mushrooms (extensive cellar under his elevated-on-pilings house), mixed human food crops, and hay. He grows many herbs and does tree grafts to grow various tree-fruit 
+_> 2) for family use. Shen’s family hails from Durpar, by way of Chessenta; his now-deceased father Thontravur was brought to Shadowdale to settle as a young child, by his parents, and Thontravur romanced and married 
+_> 3)
Velveira Almarrand, a wealthy Sembian daughter who fled her parents’ expectations and arranged marriage for a solitary subsistence life in Shadowdale; Taburg was their eldest child (his younger sister Randarla was a restless 
+_> 4) adventuring sort who joined the Harpers, traveled, and eventually died of Zhent violence in a forest ambush in Tethyr) and dwells on the farm he inherited from them with his small family: wife Shalarla, of Daggerdale stock 
+_> 5) and three strong, capable daughters who are accomplished hunters and trappers, and help elves often against Zhent and woodcutter depredations into the forests. (If your Realms campaign is set more recently, Shalarla outlived 
+_> 6)
Taburg, to a ripe old age, and like him is buried on the farm. The burial was done by their three daughters, who now share the farm, unmarried and taking various lovers from time to time, and farming as their parents did.) 
+_> 7)
The three daughters, eldest to youngest, are: Haethe (“HAY-thh”); Raedaerle (“Ray-DARE-ull”); and Tarsarra (“Tar-SAR-uh”), Tarsarra being accomplished at arms, an energetic climber of trees and cliff-faces, and known for 
+_> 8) making literally-pain-killing wine from herbs and wildflowers found on the farm, Raedaerle being the great beauty and an accomplished cook and baker, and Haethe being the strongest and a good horse and ox trainer and tender 
+_> 9) (doctor).
As for Eveningstar’s bakery: many farms have their own sideyard bake-ovens (little mortared domes of stone with a wooden door, like a pizza oven), but the dale has had at least two bakeries from the mid-1300s DR onwards. 
+_> 10)
The most famous of these is the Eveningstar Bakery on the main road.
For many years, it was the home of its owner and baker, the gruff, tall and gaunt Urda Malo, an orphan from Riatavin who ate and drank prodigiously yet never 
+_> 11) gained weight and always felt hungry; she lived alone and made “superb” daily bread and even better sweet pasteries that local Evenor bought and ate as avidly as traveling merchants did. As she grew old and frail, she hired 
+_> 12) live-in assistants, all local Evenor women, who became the bakers, and ran the Bakery together after Malo slipped into a senile dotage (they cared for her until her death of winterchill fever), and their descendants still do. 
+_> 13)
The other bakery in Shadowdale stood a little way south down the road to Mistledale, where the Temple Approach Way (the road that ran to face the southern entrance to the Temple of Chauntea, after the swamp was drained, and 
+_> 14) that temple was built) met the Mistledale Road, the SW-most building of the trio bracketed by roads, on the E side of the Mistledale Road.
It was the home and shop of Anthan Lokalarr, baker (who retired to Shadowdale from 
+_> 15)
Selgaunt’s high prices and constant intrigue, in 1377 DR), and founded The Roundloaf. Which didn’t really compete with Malo’s bakery, but sold just one thing, almost exclusively to wagon-merchants buying in bulk: 
+_> 16) hard-crust roundloaves of nourishing bread coated in cinammon-oil-treated wax to slow mold growth until it could be sold, mainly throughout Sembia.

+_> 1)
Heh. Persistence will get you everywhere.
Halvan “the Dark” was Sembian by birth and in his youth a traveling trader up and down the Dragonreach, who settled in Harrowdale and became a successful landlord and shipper.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Halvan’s full name was Halvan Deirith Mhalkhombur; he hated his family (who had come to Sembia from Turmish, two generations earlier) and tried never to use his surname (his middle name was his mother’s half-elven-heritage 
+_> 3) family surname; it was Sembian custom in those days to use the surnames of high-status or wealthy families who marry into yours, as middle names).
Halvan became Lord of what he promptly dubbed “Halvan’s Dale” in 1182 DR 
+_> 4) named as the successor of previous lord Andrur Surlwood, in papers found on Surlwood’s desk after the latter’s sudden and mysterious demise (likely of poison; Elminster doesn’t think Halvan was responsible, but rather 
+_> 5)
Surlwood’s own kin, impatient to inherit).
The moment he became lord, Halvan used his new powers and the dale’s tax coffers to become a major local moneylender, driving hard bargains and seizing property (by strictly enforcing 
+_> 6) these lending agreements) . He was not well liked by the dalesfolk, but he was respected, in part because he improved every building he came to own, and kept the dale clean, the nightsoil carted far away and composted 
+_> 7) built new breweries and shops to rent out and larger, better inn facilities, workshop and warehouse space so Sembian businesses could relocate to their advantage, and generally brought prosperity to the dale.

And then he overreached himself fatally, by starting construction of the Halfaxe Trail.
As Elminster put it, “He was doing so well by crossing his fellow humans that he thought he could cross the elves, and succeed at it

Hey Ed I have a player who committed treason against neverwinter and was going to let a cleric of Loviatar at them.
It made me think, what kind of tortures or rituals do clerics of loviatar even practice? I can't seem to find much on the wiki. 
+_> 1) No surprise that lore is scanty; this is the sort of thing that has always been censored out of the published Realms.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Every clergy of the Realms needs its own book of rituals (and daily prayers, and do’s and don’ts). That’s WAY too big a topic for Twitter. 
+_> 3)
But when it comes to punishments, there are two sorts: leave visible marks/mutilations (branding, for instance, which could be “I AM A THIEF” in Common across a forehead), and those that don’t. 
+_> 4)
Because clerics of Loviatar believe in reveling in pain and inflicting it often over a long period of time (e.g. a lifetime), they specialize in intense pain that doesn’t leave marks. Sometimes they break bones so the 
+_> 5) recipient has to deal with the pain of movement with broken bones, but more often they specialize in very fine needles applied directly to nerves, or beating the soles of the feet, or floggings with soft implements that 
+_> 6) don’t break the skin, bruise, or draw blood. The intent is to cause intense pain without damaging the recipient so numbness or shock or unconsciousness or other means of escaping the sensations kick in. 
+_> 7)
If needles are coated with certain snake venoms, and the antidotes kept handy, tiny pinpricks can cause excruciating agony that lasts and lasts. (If you've ever been bitten by a water moccasin and survived, you'll know this.)

Sorry, it’s the swords themselves that most of the NDAs apply to, though TSR did request, and get from me, and does own, the dungeon itself (a small subterranean complex/short adventure), so I can’t publish it.
What I can tell 
+_> 2) you is that the dungeon was a trapped and guarded treasure cache for these swords, and that some of them fly about (point first) defending the rest, which hang in an underground shaft (magically hovering in place).
All of the

The Dungeon was my up-my-sleeve (1976 or 1977, if I recall 
+_> 5) correctly) solution to the problem of a stable group of gamers having to split up due to leaving home for a distant university or job, moving, and so on: the DM can end up running individual characters in their own

She always wears an apron of many pockets bulging with parnsips, carrots, radishes, and the like over her homespun, and filthy boots that come up almost to her waist. A faint stench of compost and dung always clings to her.

Gnome smith Wuldrik ‘Hurlhamnmer’ Leafstone, notorious for his accuracy with hurled hammers, and his propensity for driving unwanted intruders out of his forge-room by plucking and throwing some from his plentiful always-at

Male given names: Belgor, Brace, Bran, Corl, Daern, Dorn, Engor, Farl, Foreth, Garth, Harl, Ivarn, Jeth, Joran, Landryn, Lorn, Maerand, Marl, Narn, Noke, Owyn, Randal, Randral, Robrorn, Rorn, Tal, Tanth, Taran, Vran, Wend.

Female given names: Alys, Bondra (usually “Bonnie”), Bryndra, Cathnae, Darthra, Dove, Eveene, Filfarra, Genice, Imdue, Jansra, Joyra, Kathyl, Korva, Marra, Nansyl, Pipra (“Pip”), Sarue, Soora, Tana, Tala, Tansy, Vae, Zora.

Sembia has soared in wealth and pride over the last few centuries, and many of its folk have adopted new and grander surnames and given names, trying to make themselves sound dashingly important. Some use two surnames (usually hyphenated).

Tue Feb 12 03:55:55 (Gond, Realmslore, Sword Coast, Tethyr, Toril, Waterdeep)

?_> 1)
Happy to help; here we go.
Zazesspur is no longer the capital of Tethyr, but remains a thriving port and bustling, prosperous trading crossroads, home to more than 120,000 registered taxpaying citizens. They inhabit a city of
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) smooth flagstone streets with smooth dressed-stone-slab sidewalks (a rarity in Faerûn) and soaring stone buildings, built of gray limestone quarried upriver (Zazesspur stands on the north bank of the River Sulduskoon at its 
+_> 3) mouth, where it meets the sea). The oldest buildings are square and solid, of Sword Coast North architecture like those of Waterdeep, most newer buildings have the towers, minarets, and ornamental spires in the Calishite 
+_> 4) style, and the newest buildings incorporate innovations from all over the continent, including buttresses, pedestrian bridges aloft crossing streets from structure to structure, aqueducts, and nested balconies. 
+_> 5)
Zazesspur is a walled city, except along its waterfront, and ‘sprawl’ development outside the walls has been firmly discouraged, with the result that buildings have been torn down and replaced by ever-taller buildings, over 
+_> 6) the years, so that six-and-seven-storey buildings are now common in new construction, with a strict building code that favours overbuilding to prevent collapses at all costs (for there have been mild local earth tremors 
+_> 7) every three decades or so). Homeowners displaced by the rebuilding typically ‘buy in’ to the taller structure that replaced their homes, so Zazesspur is the one city on the Sword Coast that has the equivalent of real-world 
+_> 8) condominiums: a tall building typically has a shop at street level, with an offices level above, and living-quarter floors above that, all jointly owned by the noble who typically “fronted” the building, the merchant 
+_> 9) investors who “came in on” it, and the occupants of many of the living units (multi-room suites); a few of which will typically be rented out by the joint owners, to others.
Zazesspur has deliberately copied the tolerant 
+_> 10) accept-all-races-and-outlanders-from-afar stance that has served Waterdeep so well in gaining inhabitants, trade, and wealth, so its crowded streets (where traffic flows well, as coaches and wagons have a decreed-by-law 
+_> 11) maximum size, and the local lawkeepers direct traffic with colorful batons that have earned them the nickname “the Rods,” so that only documents still refer to them as the Watch of Zazesspur) teem with races from half-orcs 
+_> 12) to elves, hailing from almost everywhere on Toril.
The docks of Zazesspur never sleep, and are brightly lit and heavily patrolled at all bells (hours are known as ‘bells’ locally, though the water-clocks now in use sound 
+_> 13) chimes rather than tolling too-loud bells). They are well served by a shipyard kept too busy doing repairs and refittings to lay the keels of new ships, sailmakers backed up with orders, and warehouses that are clean and 
+_> 14) heavily-guarded, with street youths on staff tasked with killing rats.
Wild hawks have been encouraged to roost in the hollows of the ornamental spires atop many buildings to prey on gulls, pigeons, and other seabirds, and 
+_> 15) have done so with such success that the pests, and their droppings, are almost entirely absent, and the local fishing boats lack the wheeling, squawking escorts found nigh everywhere else.
Every two summers, the Queen of 
+_> 16)
Tethyr names one of the Merchant Dukes of Zazesspur to be Mayor of the city; the honor always changes hands (no one ever holds consecutive terms) and is onerous enough (in terms of endless decisions and paperwork) that not 
+_> 17) even the power-lusty want to be Mayor all that much. The Merchant Dukes are the heads of the city-resident noble families, all of whom are styled Duke or Duchess though they lack duchies to rule. They have successfully 
+_> 18) conspired over the years to prevent city guilds from becoming powerful, but in turn have been prevented by the Crown (since the ascension of Zaranda Star) from lording it over the city. There have been feuds, and are still 
+_> 19) rivalries, between various nobles and increasingly between nobles and rising-in-wealth citizens whose treasuries are larger than the nobles but see no way short of marriage to become nobles, and resent this—but the Crown has 
+_> 20) spies all over the city whose main work is to turn ire and exasperation to new trade and business opportunities, put forward constantly by the Mayor (speaking for the Crown), so as to channel local energy and emotions into 
+_> 21) new ways for everyone to get wealthier.
As a result, Zazess (as citizens are collectively known) in general feel good about their lives and achievements, and are endlessly entertained (again, thanks to the efforts of Crown 
+_> 22) agents) with new fashions and fads, new diversions, and new plants to grow indoors and in hanging gardens outside their windows (as the Merchant Dukes enthusiastically agree with the Crown on at least one thing: they want a 
+_> 23) green, growing city where they can eat fresh vegetables and herbs plucked from their own balconies and windows).
Despite the endless parade of new fads and fashions, some local elements remain constant: Zazess like to 
+_> 24) gamble, like roast boar as part of their cuisine, prefer their fish only in sauces and hot-tureen-stews, and like round beds and round tables. Hooded weathercloaks, thanks to morning fogs and frequent light rainshowers 
+_> 25) dominate city outerwear, as do stylish boots.
Increasingly, the priests of Gond have come to Zazesspur to find sponsors for small inventions that are useful, and therefore can be made, sold, and resold in bulk across Faerûn 
+_> 26)
The city rightly sees itself as the “quieter but better” trade rival to Baldur’s Gate, Waterdeep, Calimport, and the other cities of Tethyr. They do, however, have a perennial problem with embedded spies for pirates, who 
+_> 27) always seem to know when rich cargoes are sailing outbound from Zazesspur, so they can pounce. Some Zazess want to hire their own private escort ships, crammed with armed mercenaries, to combat the pirates—but many Merchant 
+_> 28)
Dukes, and the Crown, fear such “aids” would simply become more pirates, and very swiftly, so this is a matter of ongoing local controversy.
There. That ought to do, to get you started.

Sun Jan 27 01:32:37 (Realmslore, Tethyr)

?_> [@] what is the coat of arm of Tethyr? 
+_> 1)
The blazon of Tethyr has changed many times. The current (1490s DR) arms (far simpler than most of the earlier arms, and making possible a simple badge of a shield crossed by bands of three hues, now seen on Tethyrian
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) soldiers’ surcoats and banners everywhere) are as follows: a heater-shaped shield divided into three horizontal bands (fesses) of equal height/width.
The bottom band is sky blue, and has a silver sea cat (sea lion, sometimes 
+_> 3) called a “morse” in real-world heraldry) naiant (swimming horizontally, nose facing the viewer’s left of the shield, so tail to the right) on it, representing Tethyr’s coast and the sea lions who historically rescued Prince 
+_> 4)
Nearel of Tethyr.
The middle fess is wine-red, representing the wines of the realm and its martial pride (critics say it represents all the spilled blood of Tethyrians fighting each other, down the years). In the center of 
+_> 5) this fess, right in the center of the shield, is a (sized to touch the top and bottom of the fess) simple four-pointed white star (with the points vertical and horizontal, matching the cardinal points of a map compass 
+_> 6) rather than pointing to the diagonals or elsewhere). This represents Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun and the dynasty she began.
The top (“chief”) fess is gold, representing the verdant grain crops and wealthy of the realm.

+_> Human person [@] have a theory that ‘thoughts and prayers’ en masse actually do manipulate the Weave, essentially casting a slow-burn spell that empowers their God. Is that thinking too much like a Wizard?

Yes, it is thinking too much like a wizard. ;} No foul, though: to a man with a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail (many wizards speculate just what you have).
Here’s the thing: Mystra IS the Weave. The Weave is ONE WAY (the fast, heavy-power one) of

Mon Dec 29 07:03:08 (Cult of the Dragon, NDA, Realmslore, Thay, the Realms)

?_> Hello [@] and merry Christmas! I was wondering if there is any more information on Maglas's Chronicles of Years to Come, apart from DoF, FOR 11 CotD, and the 3e LoD? Where there any other prophecies that the tome spoke about that are of interest? Or is anything else NDA? 
+_> 1)
The Chronicle of Years by Maglas the Seer consists of 4 matching volumes that contained cryptic prophecies, one to a page, with relevant notes, observations, and reports beneath each prophecy. A common mistake among members of the Cult of the Dragon is to think
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) that the simplified translation by Sammaster is the same text as the original. (Some of the references you cite describe Sammaster’s translation.)
Some of the later pages of the original were “spellbound” (their real writings concealed beneath innocuous gossip 
+_> 3) pennings by a powerful spell that had to be solved to “untwine” it and reveal the true text).
Some of the earlier pages in the original contain still-unsolved prophecies that weren’t spellbound. These include the following: 
+_> 4)
The fire shall leap up from the stone and reveal the way, on the night when stars fall and towers tumble. 
+_> 5)
When moondark cloaks the well of dragons, a new wyrm shall arise from the bones of the old in the whispering tower, and it shall be more fell and cunning than elder dragons who have slept for centuries. 
+_> 6)
Black the crown, black the scepter, black the orb, and black the mask. Yet of these, one black is false, one is blind, one empty, and one the coldest kiss of all. 
+_> 7)
Three sorcerers know the secret way into Candlekeep, but it is not unguarded. The dead walker that is its sentinel knows how to lay low he who took a name not his own, after escaping when other lions fell, to rule Thay. 
+_> 8)
Three serpents shall greet the dawn, and one shall devour it. 
+_> 9)
Six swords sleep now, but in the right hands shall awaken and whisper guidance that shall sway kingdoms, and the world shall be changed. 
+_> 10)
Seek the lady whose smile curves beneath one eye of blue, and the other of silver, for she knows the Lost Spell. 
+_> 11)
Disturb not what lies beneath Wrinklestone, for when it walks, so too shall the six dead kings, and the Realms Below shall march.

Realmslore [:]

Lucia had at least two children after Isabeau, and Inselm was likely the father of one: a boy by the name of Sardorn. The younger child was a girl, Luethaune. Both of these children used the Hhune surname, not Thione, both

+_> 5)
Isabeau Thione married thrice, and had two children, at least one (her eldest, daughter Maerlra) in wedlock (so Maerlra used the surname of her father, who was the Waterdhavian noble Zarorn Maerklos). Her son, Eldred, used

Thione as his surname. They both married and had issue, so their grandchildren (in birth order: Anadath Maerklos, NE hm; Belrard Maerklos, CE hm; Lilaedra Maerklos CN hf; Nynueeme Maerklos, CE hf; and

Molaklar Haelthin, Harbluth Orsavvar, and Talarra Tathgallant. In addition to these six heavyweights, up-and-comers at Council include Urland Tethgar (NE hm R2), a wagon seller, refurbisher, and warehouse owner who wants

The Lords left them to it, as they usually do if noble feuds don't extend to losses to others (if that fire had spread, for example). As for what caused it you'll have to ask nobles of both families who are long dead, unless you witnessed the advent of the feud.

I had another question now, about Mythals. In 5e, is there still a way to make Mythals? I'm assuming yes through High Magic, but did Mystra remove Epic Spells and Mythal Seeds? 
+_> 1)
So far as is known, no one has recently created a Mythal. Some Weavemasters and Chosen of Mystra have tinkered with/repaired existing ones. In theory, crafting a Mythal is still possible, but the problem lies in assembling
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) enough sufficiently powerful AND SKILLED participants. Such mighty wielders of Art tend to be very busy, disinclined to work with others except on their own pet projects, and paranoid about being in a known place at a known 
+_> 3) time side by side with others mighty in magic. Mystra, like all the gods post-Sundering, has “stepped back” from direct interactions with mortals, and is working more through her servitors (including the Chosen), clergy 
+_> 4) and manifestations. ALL of the incarnations of Mystra have preferred to work more on a personal basis than with a formal “no one can do this now” approach. So you might be granted the ability to understand, master, and 
+_> 5) wield an Epic Spell, while at the same time Drang the Deathdealer in the red robes next door might not, because Mystra thinks Drang will use the spell more to destroy or oppress others than to spread the use of magic to all.

Crafting a mythal requires the deepest trust and cooperation—and too few wielders of the Art are capable of making themselves so vulnerable, and being so generous. (Sigh; like too many of us, in life.)

?_> [@] On Faerun, what is the custom concerning married couples' surnames? Does the wife take the husband's? Does the husband take the wife's? Do they keep their own? What about children? Whose surname do they take? 
+_> 1)
Most ‘just plain folk’ in the Realms don’t have surnames. They have honorifics (“Garth the Baker” or “Garth the Sly” when a community has more than two Garths; if they have two, they’ll likely be “Garth The Old” and “Garth The

Unless they have clan names. Or are noble or royal, where inheritance is VERY important.
And even then, the answer is: it will vary. A lower-ranking noble, or a commoner, marrying into nobility or royalty will 
+_> 3) adopt the higher-rank surname. A widow or widower trying to hold onto a farm or other property of a deceased spouse will take their surname, even if they didn’t use it when the spouse was alive.
Most marrying couples decide 
+_> 4) among themselves if they will take a spouse’s surname (if they have one) or keep their own. They may legally adopt a spouse’s surname, but continue to use their own when working (in their own shop, or in a time or place when

Garth son of Mul and Drace” or “Garth son of Redhair
Which is a very long way of saying: except among particular families, in particular places and times, there is no one custom. There are a lot of customs.

A dwarf may be proud of her heritage and call herself “Ardra ‘Redhands’ Durth, of the South Forge Durths, of Clan Battlehammer” or she may not be proud of her heritage, and travel and adventure as just Ardra Redhands, using 
+_> 8) only the honorific she personally earned.
A young noble, sent out into the world expecting never to inherit, may decide to hide their lineage for personal safety, and adopt a surname that married into the family generations

In the case of PCs, I’d have the players roleplay the deciding on surnames. For NPCs, you

Myrkul is the god of the dead, and some of his worshippers are powerful undead (liches, vampires, and the like), whom he works with and champions the aims/causes of.
Velsharoon is the god of necromancy, and is feared or
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) detested by many undead; most of his worshippers are living mortal necromancers (who of course will also worship Myrkul and all other deities they know of).
In Elminster’s view, Myrkul is (or was; there’s a chance that all of 
+_> 3) the Dead Three returned after the Sundering more sharply limited in power than many other returning deities—though Velsharoon may well also be sharply limited) more powerful than Velsharoon, and more autonomous (Velsharoon

No one knows how gods see other gods except by what mortals can infer from what deities

However, Elminster believes, from his own past observations, that Myrkul dismisses Velsharoon as a ‘grasping mortal’ of barely

Fri May 02 01:50:13 (Realmslore)

+_> 1)
Just as in our real world, “after death” is a mystery to the living.
Priests, deities, and the servitors of deities (“angels” and the like) make various claims, and a lot of these contradict each other.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Dwarves valiant in battle often believe their souls wind up in a hall of heroes where they feast and brawl and practise until the gods have need of them to do battle, or to be “reforged” (by Moradin, at his forge) into new 
+_> 3) dwarves and sent back to live again.
Dwarf smiths and crafters believe the afterlife that awaits them is a series of spacious, wonderfully-equipped workshops where they can fulfillingly create ever-better items, knowing true 
+_> 4) satisfaction and becoming ever better at creating items that are innovative as well as ever-better-made.
Dwarf clerics believe they are the “true servants” of the (dwarven) gods, and will be first to be chosen to serve anew 
+_> 5) as a new dwarf living a new life.
Many mortals, of various races, have sages and learned priests who hold that the souls of the dead gravitate to the plane that is the home of the deity the living mortal most worshipped or 
+_> 6) best served in life, and there they dwell with their ‘chosen’ deity as petitioners, until they merge with the plane (their sentience dissolving), ascend to a planar form (an “angel” or some other sort of creature native to 
+_> 7) their god’s plane), or are reborn on the Prime Material Plane at the behest of their deity, either as themselves to fulfill some unfinished mission, or to live a new life.
All prohibitions and other details (such as 
+_> 8) non-dwarves are forbidden to enter the dwarf afterlife”) are pronouncements made by mortal clergy. They may be right, or wrong, mistaken or out-of-date, or there may be exceptions to what the clergy believe is an inflexible 
+_> 9) rule. Gods often do and say things that perplex mortals; that’s why “just plain folk” tolerate the existence of clergy, as experts who intercede and interpret.
So here’s the thing: according to Realmslore (tavern tales 
+_> 10) legends, various books and other records) many adopted dwarves (i.e. non-dwarves) have seen the dwarf afterlife. Which would mean: non-dwarves are NOT forbidden to enter the dwarf afterlife.

Fri May 16 16:18:51 (DEATH MASKS, Laeral, Masked Lord, Realmslore, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_> [@] Isn't Waterdeep an oligarchy? I mean democracy, as in somewhere all citizens (or at least a large subset, such as those who own property) decide by vote who's in charge. As far as I understand it, the Masked Lords decide who will be Masked Lords, with no input from the people? 
+_> Here's the problem with that: there are no TRUE democracies. Even ancient Athens, in which in theory all citizens had a vote, excluded women and all slaves. Canada. the UK, and most Commonwealth countries are, or started as, constitutional monarchies. The USA is a republic, [:] 
+_> 2) and arguably as much or more of an oligarchy as Waterdeep (the Masked Lords CAN be chosen from all walks of life, and don't have to own property [they DO have to have an address in the city, but can rent or stay in an inn], whereas the US electoral college memberships are 
+_> 3) controlled by two entrenched political parties). Many city-states in the Realms have even more "democratic" ruling Councils: the guilds elect one rep, the nobles another, the burghers (wealthy moneylenders = local banks) a third, and so on. Most real-world modern folks  
+_> 4) use the terms "democracy" and "freedom" very loosely. Looking objectively at Waterdeep and the modern USA, I'd say Waterdeep is the more democratic place. In both places, wealth tends to equal power, so wealthy people tend to get into "the corridors of power" if they want 
+_> 5) to. Olden-days Waterdeep, where either warlords or nobles ruled, wasn't democratic, but the Masked Lords are masked to prevent coercion, and their ranks (although tending towards corruption by the "old boys' network" factor of people who are Lords choosing friends or  
+_> 6) business colleagues or relatives to be appointed to the Masked Lords) have been filled, in recent centuries, by people who "aren't" something (as in: aren't nobles, aren't guildmasters, etc.) which has led to the fractious Lords' meetings seen in DEATH MASKS, and Lords  
+_> 7) at odds with the Masked Lord (Neverember and after him, Laeral, were chosen because they were outsiders, not longtime city residents who might be part of one camp or another). So the Lords have to bargain with each other, issue by issue, to get votes needed to pass  
+_> 8) a new law or regulation or city policy, and many things get modified in the debate. So lawmaking is by majority vote, and the people voting represent all of the citizenry (high and low, all races and genders and ethnicities) which is the essence of democracy.
EVERY real 
+_> 9) world democracy can be labeled (this one's a constitutional monarchy, that one's a republic, or this one's an oligarchy, that one's a theocracy, etc.), but as we saw in DEATH MASKS, the Masked Lords aren't free of public pressure at all, and their personal agendas (or  
+_> 10) those of the group they represent, or belong to) get derailed time and again by public demands, and by the groups they belong to not having monolithic views. And there are also criminal interests (the Xanathar, Bregan D'aerthe) who like all of this political mess and

This answer is a simplication through generalization, but: Anauroch is a low-water desert of all sorts from hot sands (summer only; cold sands in winter) through wind-scoured rock to frigid ice-sheathed rock as one moves north.
Calimshan is a hot sands desert

Deep aquifers make life in Raurin sustainable for those who know how to tap them, or keep to known wells and oases.
Anauroch is too large to cross alive for someone who doesn't know its oases (and desert ways), and the Calim Desert is a heat- and parch- killer.

A few less-learned orcs, or those in a real hurry, would just omit them, especially if carving stone.

They tut-tutted (issuing a stern proclamation), and they required the two feuding families to pay reparations to the families of the non-family members who died. The nobles ignored that, so the Lords paid out of city coffers, and added it to the taxes of the two

Oh, those NOBLES! When folk get too much money, they go crazy! Nobles have ALWAYS behaved like that! We expect it. If they didn't, we'd wonder if they really WERE nobles. Or, if they were quiet and well-behaved, like all of those nobles, over there, we'd

Here’s the thing: at the height of the “empire” of Netheril, Netheril consisted of many enclaves, a lot of them what are now referred to as “flying cities” (which, yes, fly about and so are mobile), created by Netherese

Thanks in advance!

If you mean the Thann noble family of Waterdeep, Rhammas ‘the Younger’ died in 1478 DR (of natural causes, at a ripe old age), and was succeeded as patriarch of House Thann by his second son Oraskar (the eldest son, Tontar
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) died in a tavern brawl in 1472). So Oraskar is head of the family in 1479 DR.
Rhammas was a widower; his consort, Palaerla Cragsmere Thann, died of heartstop in 1464 DR. Upon becoming patriarch, Oraskar was in his fifth 
+_> 3) decade of life, and his health had never been strong, so from the moment he became head of the family, he wasn’t expected to last long, and left most of the brawling and speaking in public and being a vigorous and energetic

Baraskan are their two sisters, Sharleen and Daraerra. They are quiet, graceful women; Bendrigo says they each have more brains than all of the living male Thanns put together, himself included.

It depends. When first introduced, they filled rooms. And required constant tending/refilling due to evaporation, because they had so many open bowls and spillways. Most bore enchantments (not to construct them, but for effects they produced, to mark the passing

Derlusk is a port city of winding old streets crammed with two- and three-storey old houses. Most, at street level, are bookshops, selling all manner of books, from collected sermons to lurid fiction chapbooks to old histories. Upper floors of these buildings are

As a result, the Tramnurs, who are quite willing to pay skilled guild workers very well for ‘top-goblet’ work, and to use that skilled labor to

Shar created the Shadow Weave to obey her (for the use of mortals loyal to her), but it "leans on"/is an echo of/calls on the Weave (who is Mystra herself, and a webwork spanning the world that is a way of calling on the natural forces of the world). As an echo

+_> 3) by Mystra (and Ao), so no one can use it to craft or cast magics beyond what mortals can use the Weave for. Yes, powerful archwizards and archliches and even dragons have tried and failed. Usually the spell just doesn't work, but if the 'wrong' forces have

Thu Apr 17 17:55:58 (Azoun IV, Brimstone Angels, Cormyr, Realmslore, Shadowdale, Volo)

?_> [@] if you might indulge my perverse sociological fascination:
As I’m sure you’re familiar, in our own world that at times one’s station might provide rights/privileges to actually wear certain clothes, adornments, colours . . even to this day one of high enough rank /1 
+_> 1)
Published Realmslore touches on this a time or three in CORMYR: A NOVEL and ELMINSTER’S DAUGHTER and the Sage of Shadowdale trilogy, Volo’s Cormyr, and in my long-running series of web columns (wherein we saw glimpses of the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) private lives of Azoun and Filfaeril, as setups for the topic of each column). You can also glean a fair bit of Cormyrean social mores and etiquette while reading the superb Brimstone Angels novels By Erin M. Evans. 
+_> 3)
However, there’s no comprehensive published ‘Cormyrean Court Etiquette’ guide.
But here’s the short version pertaining to the in-game situation you describe: except at coronations, royal funerals, investitures (giving 
+_> 4) courtiers, nobles, or royalty new titles/formal new duties, like a wardenship), and weddings of nobility and royalty (even to commoners), nobles don’t wear their coronets/tiaras. Which, along with the robes, is what you’re 
+_> 5) seeing when real-world British peers ‘dress up’ thus.
There are many royal feasts, revels, and balls, including the seasonal ‘presentations’ (wherein young nobility are presented to the court as marriageable and available 
+_> 6) like the ‘coming out’ parties for real-world bluestocking debutantes) at which coronets and tiaras need not be worn (although some conservative or especially haughty nobles do wear them), and guests brought by a highborn 
+_> 7) would be seated with them if seating is a concern (at revels, it isn’t, and at many feasts since the ascension of Azoun IV the precedence problem is avoided by having many small, round tables where ‘converse and eat’ groups 
+_> 8) can form of their own accord, among friends and cliques and family, or folk who want to discuss business or sports or pastimes or just gossip together, not by rank). At such events, there’s very little in the way of garments 
+_> 9) that would be considered scandalous (though dirty unclad nudity would come close), because so many attendees use such occasions, like modern real-world ‘Hollywood red carpet’ occasions, for wearing daring fashions. 
+_> 10)
However, you will see a wide variety of garments on display, from uniforms for courtiers and serving military to frilly and revealing gowns, and everything in between.

Sat Sep 20 23:24:32 (Realmslore, Toril)

?_> Hey [@] quick question. I'm going to run King Lareths council in the Galena Mountains on the 14th of Marpenoth, 1372 DR In around 12 hours. How tall are the Galena Mountains, and what temperature would it be around that time of year?
Thanks!
Realmslore #dnd 
+_> 1)
So Marpenoth is the Torilian equivalent of October, and the Galena range (named by TSR, by the way, after a resort they used to go to on retreats, which was of course named for the mineral) is roughly as northerly as
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) halfway north up Canada” in climate terms. The Galenas themselves are tall, jagged fangs of very sharp, rugged rock, tall enough to be permanently topped with ice and snow (which at that latitude means they must all be over 
+_> 3) feet in elevation; my notes have them as around 11,000, with the tallest summits being just over 14,000). The range is only about 25 miles wide, with nigh NO level ground, and cascading streams and rivers rather than 
+_> 4) navigable ones (the Galena Snake being the most well-known named river), plus of course lots of hostile resident giants, orcs, hobgoblins, and goblins. There are rich iron, silver, and bloodstone deposits (and heck, to make 
+_> 5) the name fit, lots of galena). So in October, daytime in-sun temperatures would be above freezing in the lowest reaches of the mountains only. At night, particularly with windchill, “deep freeze” indeed. Yes, exposed PCs 
+_> 6) could readily freeze to death. PCs in caverns would likely be okay, but not comfortable. The Galenas are not known for gales or frequent high winds, though.

+_> 1)
In Cormyr, in the 1300s DR and the 1400s DR, interested nobles and courtiers alike can hire instruction for themselves and their children (older than toddlers and up) in unarmed arts known as ‘Shieldwall,’ although it’s far 
+_> 2) more tumbling and sidestepping and aikido-like swaying and balancing and pivoting than it is any sort of shield-like action. The instructors tend to be old, limping, arthritic retired Purple Dragons who’re good at teaching

Cormyr and Marsember have a small handful each of resident tutors, and the coastal areas see another three

Draetha, who attracts male attention wherever she goes.
All are good, patient tutors who don’t mind being handled by patrons or repeating moves over and over until someone masters what they’re teaching, and all are far smarter

Thu Jun 19 03:38:44 (Realmslore, Tethyr, the Realms)

?_> A Question for [@] on mundane. What exactly are these alcoholic beverages in the #ForgottenRealms : Delayed blast, Dragon's bite, Flaming gullet, Red rum swirl, Yeti's breath. #dnd #dungeonsanddragons #FRLore 
+_> 1)
These are all mixed drinks (“cocktails” to us), and were all on offer in The Hidden Lady in the 1300s DR, as seen in the Realms novel AZURE BONDS.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Delayed Blast is named for its sudden back-of-the-throat alcoholic kick, wherein it dims the imbiber’s hearing and pain, and leads to a detached feeling of euphoria—right after a painful “searing fire” onset in the back of the 
+_> 3) nose and forehead that often makes drinkers shudder, gasp or swear, and shake their heads (the “blast,” which takes place only some minutes after a particular drinker has first begun drinking; how long varies with each 
+_> 4) drinker. A Delayed Blast is a particular combination of sarrak (a Rashemi and Impilturan drink; we would call it “potato-based vodka”), “red renth” [cherry juice], and sweetstalk (a celery-like sweet green vegetable that 
+_> 5) grows wild across the Heartlands, and is often found, cultivated, in cottage gardens). 
+_> 6)
A Dragon’s Bite is a drink made with mint wine (pale, translucent green), pepper brandy (a strong cordial made with crushed black pepper and sweet red peppers), powdered cinammon, and licorice root. It’s minty and cool, with 
+_> 7) a nutty, not sweet but not bitter licorice aftertaste, that ends with a scorching-hot cinammon flare in the throat (the “bite”). 
+_> 8)
A Flaming Gullet is never, tavern tales to the contrary, served alight and flaming; it just causes a searing on-fire sensation in a drinker’s throat (and, incidentally, completely clears the sinuses, with swift expulsion of 
+_> 9) all snot). An amber-hued drink, it is made from the right mix of klaraunth (barley vodka from Chessenta, Tethyr, or the Vilhon), the “juice” (distillate) of hot red radishes, the “juice” (distillate) of horseradish root 
+_> 10) and powdered chestnuts. 
+_> 11)
A Red Rum Swirl is a comfort drink; that is, it’s gentle on the throat, nutty and pleasant to the taste, and often causes extreme drunkenness because the imbiber didn’t realized how potent it was, and drank too much of it. 
+_> 12)
It is red in hue, due to the cherry brandy added sparingly to it, its base is indeed rum, and that rum is mixed with generous amounts of almond brandy and stirred-in caramel (made beforehand by slowly heating and stirring 
+_> 13) together butter, cream, and cane or beet sugar). 
+_> 14)
A Yeti’s breath is so-called because it’s ice-cold to a drinker, in part because of the menthol in it, in part because of the crushed ice that’s an essential ingredient, and in part because the main body of the drink is 
+_> 15) tapdragon (sugar cane molasses-based vodka), to which is added darsargar (powdered ginger). The last ingredient, menthol, comes from peppermint oil, derived from the abundant wild peppermint plant.

+_> 1)
The young, ambitious Manshoon magically farscried (spied on) some beholders he knew dwelt not far west and northwest of Zhentil Keep, to see if they were as interested in influencing/meddling with the affairs of humans as he
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) suspected. He was right, they were (wielding power being what they thirsted for more than aught else, with manipulating the unaware a close second), and they were concentrating on the Moonsea area with its lucrative

So he magically prepared with mantles and wardings he altered to protect himself against beholder eyestalk powers, notably their anti-magic rays. How? Well, those few who know how can ‘fold’ the Weave in 
+_> 4) a small at-hand area so area-effect and aimed spells hurled at a target will be misdirected into the (invisible) fold, leaving the target, just beyond the fold, unaffected).
This allowed Manshoon to visit the beholders he’d 
+_> 5) judged as suitable allies and survive their attacks long enough for them to hear him out as he sought to convince them he could be their tool (to work on humans where their direct personal presence would cause 
+_> 6) fear/hate/headlong flight). So certain of the eye tyrants took a chance on working with him, were very impressed with the results and with the organization (the Zhentarim) he was building and how they could use it as a 
+_> 7) widespread extension of their own schemes and wills, and became his allies. Taming the priests of Bane Manshoon couldn’t dominate by himself, or with the assistance of Fzoul (who has gained from the strivings of others for 
+_> 8) his entire life). The beholders exulted at how this extended their reach, making them truly influential across Faerûn, and also took note of how careful Manshoon was to obey them precisely, hide nothing from them, and 
+_> 9) sugar-coat nothing, so their trust in him grew. “A willing and attentive thrall,” the beholder Xuuvarathar described him, to other eye tyrants.
In contrast to the Zhentarim, Red Wizards have battled with beholders, sought to

Mind flayers have never tried to impersonate zulkirs, so far as I know, but they have tried—with very little

Fri Jul 04 03:50:38 (Elminster, Realmslore)

+_> Guy [@] you please relate any more tales of Elminster's visits to Earth please? More stories of a vaguely friendly visitor would be soothing in these troubled times. 
+_> 1)
Sure. :}
Recently, El wanted a ride in a canoe on a placid northern Ontario lake, and got one.
He now knows that standing up in a canoe and LEANING is a good way to get wet. Luckily for him, he knows a spell that can expel all 
+_> 2) excess water from clothing, hair, and body. Unluckily for me, the magic just hurls a wet mist out in all directions. Yuck. 
+_> 3)
Several visits: El loves lightning storms, and striding over the gently manicured hills of golf courses with his staff held high, getting struck repeatedly by lightning. DON’T TRY THIS; he’s an archwizard and foolhardy to boot. 
+_> 4)
Some old camping glades survive in some of Toronto’s ravine parks (log seats in a ring, well away from the paved paths and manicured areas). Lots of teenagers discover these, and so, in these COVID times, have some local 
+_> 5) fantasy and sf fans and writers, who get together to drink and chat from afternoons until moondown in the wee hours (safely distanced). Far from me, a hundred-some miles east out in the countryside, I’m afraid, but El remembered their moots 
+_> 6) and attended. In disguise as, well, me. (!)
He assures me he behaved, and told me he loves the energy, idealism, crazy ideas and passionate discussions of them, and the youthful cynicism, too (“so CUTE,” he deemed it). 
+_> 7)
El also confessed to attending—in a different guise—a not-yet-released-TTRPG playtest in a Toronto-area basement.
Their ideas of magic are so TWISTED,” he told me.
Cthulhu twisted?” I asked.
Worse,” he said darkly. 
+_> 8)
And of course the Old Mage made his usual raids on my larder and wine cellar. No ice cream (I’m being a good diabetic; El did NOT approve), and he found some of the libations I procured for my library ladies (co-workers at the 
+_> 9) day job) bewildering (as in: “Folk DRINK this cr—stuff? WILLINGLY?”), but enjoyed others (leaving me a heap of empty bottles). He also read some of the novels I’m working on, and found them HILARIOUS.
Some were even meant to be funny. 
+_> 10)
I’ll add this: having seen many folks wearing masks to guard against the coronavirus, El can’t understand why we don’t all seize the opportunity to wear plague doctor masks or wilder face coverings with snouts and so on. 
+_> 11)
Folk in your world need to PLAY more,” he told me, “and not just when they’re young. Life is too short to stop having fun.” He then used a spell to conjure up pies and started a pie fight. My cat was NOT impressed.

+_> Travis Mayes [@] it appears the web update on Waterhavian noble houses was made when the Dark Three were in active. Are there any noble houses with secret widespread affiliations with Bane, Bhaal, or Myrkul?

No. The ethos of those deities don’t fit with what noble houses need and want: longevity, security of the status quo with them on top, respect for life so they don’t get assassinated, and so on. All sane, intelligent humans

Sun Feb 10 00:32:50 (Border Kingdoms, Realmslore, Tethyr)

+_> Tommy Hanusa [@] is anything happening in Port Kir(akaSeacity)in Firedrake Bay,Tethyr? I'm not sure there has been any mention of it since 2e (1390 DR). Has anything been suggested or is it a place ready for a little adventure? 
+_> 1)
Port Kir’s star lobster fishery fell on hard times in the 1440s DR (almost certainly due to overfishing), but resourceful locals turned to the mounds of long-discarded lobster shells along the docks and started grinding them 
+_> 2) up in combination with clay and rotted herbs and grasses to make fertilizer that was sold in bulk throughout Tethyr (lobster shells have a certain reek, but their chitin holds moisture and deters insects, and they impart 
+_> 3) calcium and magnesium (calcium helps plants develop cell walls and inhibits blossom end rot and other vegetable afflictions and diseases).
So Port Kir, thanks to the smell, is little favoured as a stop for visitors, but its 
+_> 4) folk make a good living, and locals are used to the everpresent stench. This reek keeps it off the rolls of places to visit and explore, so fugitives from various feuds and justice in other places have gravitated to Port Kir 
+_> 5) as they do to the Border Kingdoms. Which means some surprising individuals can be found living quietly under assumed names in Port Kir. Some of them are extremely wealthy, and put their coins to use sponsoring adventurers 
+_> 6) shipbuilding (so Port Kir now has a bustling shipyard, turning out new cogs and caravels for shipping and for pirate clientele desiring fast new ships; in return, pirates never raid Port Kir), and city properties (rental and 
+_> 7) building anew) in Saradush and Darromar.
Port Kir still looks like a small, modest backwater (except for the bustling shipyard and the obvious digging away at the hills of lobster shells), but many of its simple homes hide 
+_> 8) extensive traps, defensive inner rooms, and stone-lined cellars with escape tunnels to other homes and to warehouses.

Fri Jan 04 23:39:49 (Cormyr, Eveningstar, Realmslore)

?_> [@] Does Eveningstar have a coat of arms circa 1367? I'm using the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar module (love it) and one of the PCs is a bit of a heraldry nut. Also, I'm having difficulty figuring out how Cormyr treats non-human/-demihuman PCs. Any advice on that? Thanks! 
+_> 1)
Sure. Cormyr’s treatment of a PC will depend on their race (elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes are accepted, half-orcs are eyed with suspicion, and drow and all goblinkin [orcs, goblins, etc.] evoke a “run for your weapons
Realmslore [:]

Lady Lord Tessaril Winter has her own blazon, but Eveningstar as a place at that time has as its arms a simple (heater-shaped) shield bearing a sky-blue horizontal band 
+_> 3) across its upper third, with a gray horizontal band under it, a forest green band under that, and the bottom third of the shield being royal blue with a point-down triangle of three white four-pointed stars floating in it 
+_> 4)
The top band represents the sky, the gray band is the cliff that’s the local southern edge of the Stonelands, the green band represents the verdant farm production of the village, and the blue bottom triangle is the

Starwater River (with stars reflected in its waters). As a badge (worn on the breasts of surcoats and the shoulders of jerkins), this was simplified into a point-down royal-blue triangle adorned with a point-down triangle 
+_> 6) of three white dots. When the local militia was mustered, they wore armbands or baldric (diagonal across-the-body) sashes displaying this badge. Purple Dragons, however, wore the arms of Cormyr.

Here an immense statue releases a deadly lightening bolt into the room every few rounds. But in the past something of immense power removed the head and fingers of the statue. Who did this and why? [:] 
+_> 1)
The Grim Statue was magically transported into Undermountain by Halaster. He did this to see if a new spell of his devising could translocate, intact, such as large stone statue. He was successful, and then enspelled the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) statue to be the anchor discharge point of a ‘Weave loop’ that generates endless magical lightning bolts, as one of the perils of the dungeon that it amused him to inflict on intruders.
The statue he’d ‘borrowed’ came from a

Undermountain much later happened upon the statue, and sought to stop its lightning bolts by magically destroying the statue’s fingers. When this didn’t work, they tried vaporizing the head with a second spell—which failed to

?_> [@] Evergold, the Fountain of Beauty, the Fountain of Youth,or the Fountain of Youth and Beauty. Is it really the actual source of all elven and eladrin beauty? What would happen if it were destroyed, corrupted or clogged up so to speak? 
+_> 1)
No, Evergold isn’t the source of all elven or eladrin beauty or longevity. It is a nigh-pure-energy cleanser and renewer for ALL life, divine or mortal. It can’t be successfully clogged up or destroyed except in one place—
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) because to destroy, bury, or block it in one place just causes it to move to another. It can’t be corrupted/tainted/contaminated except momentarily and in a very small area, because it cleans, purifies, or expels (literally 
+_> 3) teleporting every atom of the intruding substance elsewhere) whatever’s being used to try to dirty it. It never exists in just one place at once, so even trying to reach all parts of it at the same time, across the many 
+_> 4) planes of existence, is very difficult (remember, many of its locations are guarded by deities and/or their servitors, and enchantments they have ringed such locales with)—and the deities linked to it can also be vessels and

So attempts to destroy, corrupt, or clog it are very likely to fail. Elminster believes that if one succeeded, Evergold would just manifest (come into being) elsewhere, unheralded

?_> [@] , O sagacious one, apologies in advance if this has been answered elsewhere but I wanted to inquire about the Spellplague. What happened to those affected by it, such as the Spellscarred, after the Second Sundering? Thanks!

It varies. In a few individuals, the changes wrought in them by the Spellplague faded in intensity after the Second Sundering was over; in a VERY few cases, they faded away altogether. Most people were permanently
Realmslore [:]

+_> Gilmore's glorious wood [@] · 10h [@] We haven't heard from Berdusk in 5E much. How is the Harper city faring, and what are the struggles it's going through in the 1490s DR? Thanks as always :) 
+_> 1)
Berdusk remains a Harper base, and under their protection generations of artisans have flourished, making the city a stronghold of skilled carpentry, smithing, and crafting; throughout the 1400s it has exported a lot of 
+_> 2) useful furniture, tools, housewares (pottery, hinges, locks and hasps, pots and pans and cutlery), draperies, and decorative statuettes, lanterns, and small wall paintings. This makes it a popular caravan stop, as Berduskans 
+_> 3) will always buy food, and sell well-made and stylish items (tinder boxes, locks with sets of keys, ‘strongbox’ coffers, tools and cutlery) that merchants can readily resell elsewhere.
Over the past century, a local nobility 
+_> 4) (the wealthy who wisely sponsored others, and became even more wealthy and able to go on sponsoring others, plus enriching themselves by building granaries and warehouses all can rent space in) has grown up in Berdusk. 
+_> 5)
These ‘First Folk’ consist of twenty or so families (some large, some small), who appoint a ruling High Lord or High Lady from among their number. Perennially most influential among these noble families are the houses of 
+_> 6)
Calanthal, Hardomeir, Myrmrast, Qarlagast (notorious locally for madness in the family, a reputation that began when the Spellplague hit and several mages in the family went spectacularly, energetically insane and destroyed 
+_> 7) many buildings in the city until slain; much of the family today are believed to be skilled wielders of the Art), and Spaeruthal. House Calanthal are proud, prickly, and have a family tradition of training to become deadly 
+_> 8) swordwielders (duelists). House Spaeruthal is just as proud, and perhaps the wealthiest of all. The current ruler of Berdusk is High Lady Lashantha Duarn, who takes—and heeds—advice in secret from the Harpers, and so rules 
+_> 9) far more wisely than most First Folk would be likely to. As a result, she’s increasingly unpopular and mistrusted by her fellow nobles, but more and more popular and trusted by other Berduskans.
Right now, Berdusk is 
+_> 10) dominated by squabbles (not quite open feuds, but trade disputes through proxies) between rival nobles, who unite on one issue: preventing the formation of local guilds (or breaking up those that do form, before they can 
+_> 11) wield any useful power). In this they’ve thus far succeeded, but their worst excesses have been sharply curbed by merchant costers using the city as a way-base, and by the Harpers of Twilight Hall. 
+_> 12) (High Lady Cylyria Dragonbreast was increasingly afflicted by the periodic mania that beset her throughout her life, and vanished circa 1396 DR; her fate is unknown. The Harpers informed Berdusk that she’d perished in the 
+_> 13) fall of that year, but they never spoke of her death to fellow Harpers, and city rumor has her going mad, taking another name, and wandering off across Faerûn, or seeking refuge in Evereska or Evermeet. 
+_> 14)
But then, city rumors have Harpers doing many, many wild and odd things. In 1397 Dr, Berdusk’s First Folk selected Ingaram Caunter as High Lord, and he ruled capably for two decades.)

Like any other interaction, that depends on the situation and the relationships between the individuals involved. In places where many folk work magic, like Thay and Halruaa, access to magical means is increased, but spellcasting still has value/price; it's 
Realmslore [:]

Or to put it another way, even among wizards in Halruaa and Thay, someone who says, "I fireball it, whatever it is! I ALWAYS fireball things!" and means it, is going to be treated warily.
Treating magic lightly is ALWAYS playing with fire.

Many faiths separate ‘worldly’ or adventuring clerics from ‘holy’ or administrative clergy in various subtle ways, and sometimes these translate into “less powerful devotees who are better administrators

+_> 1)
It’s impossible for her to pose as a member of a Mirabarran merchant house IN Mirabar, as everyone’s on the lookout for spies (in the pay of the Zhents, Luskan, or Hellgate Keep), but in the Mirabar District of Luskan, she
Realmslore [:]

+_> 3)
Much will depend on three factors: her behavior, how much tumult is going on (i.e. losses in the alleys of Luskan among trading company personnel, so she could convincingly have been hired on in desperation), and her clan 
+_> 4) (i.e. her dwarven heritage). If she’s from afar, NOT Mirabar, it might work. Otherwise, she couldn’t “masquerade” as a merchant house member: she’d either really be one, of long standing, or she’d be an obvious liar.

And if she’s judged to be false, most will consider her a spy for someone who should at best be eliminated at the earliest convenient opportunity, unless she can be fed false information for some short-term benefit.

+_> Travis Mayes [@]  [@] a related note can you tell us a little about Ebondeath and Strongor Bonebag? 
+_> 1)
Chardansearavitriol or “Ebondeath” was a male black dragon who ruled a demesne from his lair in Uthtower. He became a dracolich in 922 DR under the urging of, and with the magical assistance of, Cult of the Dragon member, and 
+_> 2) priest of Myrkul, Strongor Bonebag. Ebondeath agreed to seek lichdom because he was elderly and keenly felt the aches and lessened strength of his aging.
The Cult built the Mausoleum of Ebondeath at Uthtower, and came there to 
+_> 3) worship him (becoming known as “the Ebondeath Sect”). It was led by Strongor until he was murdered in 969 DR by a younger, ambitious rival Cult member, who hoped not just to eliminate him, but capture his soul and sentience 
+_> 4) in the weapon that slew him, a specially-enchanted obsidian-bladed dagger. It’s not known if the ritual succeeded in doing so; Strongor’s murderer (whose name Elminster knows not) disappeared—and may himself have perished 
+_> 5) thanks to magical traps prepared by Strongor.
Ebondeath’s dracolich form disintegrated into dust in 1202 DR, when caught in the gaze of the Eye of Myrkul, but his spirit still clung to this dust, and the Cult continued to 
+_> 6) worship him, in increasing numbers (inspired by the persistence of the spectral Ebondeath beyond the destruction of his dracolich skeleton).
When Myrkul was destroyed in 1358 DR, a “great howling wind of darkness” swept into 
+_> 7) the Mausoleum, and scoured it bare—and the ghostly Ebondeath was seen no more. The Ebondeath Sect faded away, though Harper spies have heard Cultists fearfully telling each other that they’ve “heard the rage-filled whispers 
+_> 8) of Ebondeath in the night,” hissing into their ears that “they betrayed and abandoned” Chardansearavitriol. So something of the bodiless dracolich survives yet.
Elminster, Azuth, and certain senior Cult of the Dragon 
+_> 9) members all deem a handful of such dracoliches, whose bodies have decayed, “demidracoliches.” The Cult reveres them, the Wearers of Purple inner circle hunt them in hopes of gaining some hold over them and making use of

?_> [@] Hi Ed! I'm trying to figure out the specifics of farmhouses in Eveningstar, specifically the way they were dug out of the earth "like a giant rabbit warren". What sort of methods did they employ to pull this off? Thanks! 
+_> 1)
By no means all of the farmhouses were like this. The oldest ones all were, though: you pile up earth into a hill, and build your house in the lee of it (prevailing wind in Eveningstar blows from the NW, so the hill, upon which you plant vine crops and shrub herbs for home [:] 
+_> 2) kitchen use and to anchor the soil, and for the latter reason often plant fruit trees just upwind of the hill, too, stands to the NW of where you want your front door. Then you dig into the hill, and line those inner rooms with stone; the earth shelters them and keeps  
+_> 3) them at a fairly constant temperature. If you need to expand storage cellars, you can extend the hill, usually into a crescent shape, and tunnel it farther. Then your "front rooms" jut out of the hill on the lee (sheltered) side, the E or SE (the Stoneland-edge cliff just 
+_> 4) north of Eveningstar caused those from-the-NW winds to veer and blow straight E in some spots in the village. So your house is half (or a little more, or a little less) dug into its own little hill. Giving you rooms that in the frigid depths of winter would be free of all 
+_> 5) wind chill AND warm enough so that milk, water, other non-alcoholic liquids, and small critters wouldn't freeze. 
+_> 6)
So you started by building a stone house, or at least half of a stone house, with tile or stone roof sealed with a LOT of hardfired clay, pitch, etc. and then you shovel-built a hill around it. The approach (the sidewalls of the entry "slice" into the hill) could be  
+_> 7) dry-laid fieldstone or timber cribbing or whatever you could afford, and could rebuild yourself in a few years as the shifting, settling earth inevitably shoved at it.

?_> Sir [@] i was thinking a lot about ice magics due to my own party having an unintended icy themed selection of gear.
Given the relative ubiquity of, at least, minor cantrippy magics how much do realmsians rely on refrigeration, or even just putting ice /1 
+_> 1)
Just as in our real world, most folk in the Realms can’t afford to hire magic, and can’t work their own (though many villages have local citizens who make a living employing their particular ‘wild talent’ to light fires or
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) illuminate or whatever).
So they make use of ice-houses and cold cupboards and deep cellars (i.e. natural stone heat sinks and the ambient underground temperature) to keep things cool, combined with blocks of ice cut in winter 
+_> 3) and dragged into such places.
If they can afford the spells of local priests or wizards, they augment these arrangements with occasional cold magics in the worst rises of heat, to prevent food spoiling and loss of all ice 
+_> 4) and so on.
Usually this means the local temple (of any non-fire, non-smith deity, not just Auril) provides cold storage facilities in its own underground cellars (with priests casting cold spells in rota to keep things cold) 
+_> 5) and locals, for fees/offerings, come to fetch their own goods from said cold storage (priest brings to them, they don’t get to go down and rummage) or to buy cold-stored goods from the priests (like eel or fish laid in 
+_> 6) in bulk’ by the temple, and maintained as a ‘feed the community’ store).
No, there are no carts except as delivery-carts in winter, when harbor ice can be used to keep cart contents cold. In other words, the carts rush goods 
+_> 7) to customers who order, they DON’T wander the streets playing tunes to attract passing shoppers. In Waterdeep, eelcicles ARE sold (as are fish, so you buy “coldsear silverfin” or “coldsear harbor eel”), but only in the cold 
+_> 8) depths of winter, and they’re made like this:
Eels netted, brought out of the sea, chopped into thumb-length or shorter segments, and cooked in sour wine or beer to cut their natural slime, then grilled (seared) with spices 
+_> 9) and herbs for a better taste, then dropped into shallow pans of frigid harbor water to be frozen into thin sheets of ice, then the customer comes to the Dock Ward shops where this is done with their own bucket, pay for the 
+_> 10) amount they want (it’s cheap: 1 cp buys a big bucket-full) then the proprietor chops the edge of a sheet with a hatchet, shovels the ice-and-eel shards into the customer’s bucket, and off they go (to dine in the warmth of 
+_> 11) their own home or rented lodging, when the ice thaws).
I’ve eaten eel, and lamprey, and can assure you that for my stomach at least, the cutting-the-slime AND searing with seasonings steps are highly necessary steps. We 
+_> 12) real-worlders would likely use a dry rub, as for steaks, for that grilling step. Enjoy! (And if you don’t, well, the bucket you fetched the eel in is handy, for returning the eel to the wider world. Ahem.)

Fri Aug 01 17:51:53 (Realmslore, Toril, the Realms, the Weave)

+_> Zakaarus [@] have a question
Why are mages in Toril unable to cast magic in places within realmspace where the weave is damaged or dead, but are able to still do so in the outer planes where Mystra doesn't reach at all? 
+_> 1)
The Weave (Mystra) is one way of accessing the natural energies of a plane or world; arcane spells used by mages are means of calling on those energies (wind, tide, magnetism, kinetic energies such as flowing or falling 
+_> 2) water, heat/convection, etc.) to power specific effects (e.g. a fireball). Where the Weave is damaged or dead, the “trigger” (cast spell) is missing its gun to produce the effect (fire the bullet). In all cases on an outer 
+_> 3) plane where an arcane spell does work (and there are long, long lists of spells that don’t work, or that produce different effects than in the Realms), this means the magic has found a way to call on the natural energies of 
+_> 4) that plane to produce the desired effect, or at least an effect. Yet there’s a reason magic is called “the Art” and not a science; it’s often unpredictable at best. 
+_> 5)
Hence the continued utility of a sword or even a club, and someone to swing it.

I can only speak for the Realms. In which merfolk are born live, are functional but not mature (cannot reproduce) at birth, become mature in 20-30 years, typically stay with their parents for their first 20-30 years, and

?_> Hi [@] ! Reading some Eveningstar lore, I wonder why the church of Lathander chose to put such a big temple in a little village ? Was it because of a prophecy, a holy vision, a very pragmatic reason ? Have a nice day, sir. 
+_> 1)
Very pragmatic reason. It's a temple and FARM. And owns the high pastures atop the Stonelands and rents them out to locals to graze their sheep.
Farmers sell produce to the temple; the priests wash, sort, grade, and pack the vegetables, then ship them to Suzail 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) and Arabel for sale at much higher prices. So the farmers get convenience (no long trips and high costs and need for good wagons and big teams of draft beasts) and the temple gets a middleman profit. Trebled when produce shipped from Suzail to other markets.

Yes. Each person about to be married takes their own ring to the same smith (in Waterdeep, many "storefronts" for gnomes and dwarves reach anvils in the Warrens) and are ("betrothal rings" are worn on middle fingers in the Realms) "sized
Realmslore [:]

Then both rings are cut in half, the non-matching halves fused together to create two half-and-half "union" rings, made (either by adding new material or by thinning the rings to stretch what's already there) to fit the respective middle fingers (resizing visits  
+_> 3) may be necessary). These are worn to the ceremony on fine neck-chains by the partners-to-be, then exchanged, each puts the ring on the other, and at the end of the vows, the rings are clinked together to end the ceremony, so the kissing and feasting can start.

Sun Mar 02 20:19:21 (Luskan, Mirtul, Realmslore, the Realms)

+_> Belial Lyka [@] Heya, Ed. What kinds of flora and (non-monster) fauna might one encounter travelling the Northern Means and then Ten Trail from Luskan to Ten Towns? If seasonality has bearing on it, the period would be Tarsakh going into Mirtul, though elsewhen'd be  
+_> be interesting, too. 
+_> 1)
In a typical year, this would be the beginnings of snowmelt, with frequent ground-fogs at dawn and dusk, but with the ground still hard-frozen (little to no mud), below freezing at nights, and with frequent storms that are 
+_> 2) either sleet or light swirling snow, not rain. All of this dampness keeps the stinging insects down that at other times of year will make this leg of the journey very unpleasant.
The first leg of the journey (along the 
+_> 3)
Northern Means) will be through frozen reeds and grasses, and bushes denuded of all berries and leaves by hungry beasts, many stands of leafless trees (the big “forest giants” all logged off years ago, so mainly old 
+_> 4) gnarl-trees and saplings), and rolling hills with rock outcrops (festooned here and there with edible lichens; an upcoming AMARUNE’S ALMANAC will have more to say about them and other cold-land plants). Every creature that 
+_> 5) doesn’t hibernate or go into torpor will be hungry and therefore out on the land in desperation, from rabbits, hares, and voles to deer and the packs of wolves looking to dine on them all. Bears aren’t yet emerging from their 
+_> 6) dens (they won’t be seen until late Mirtul in these areas). Hunting out of Luskan and Fireshear and the topography will make rothé rare sights, though they may be well back off the road in some of the most open areas; you’d 
+_> 7) see more of them had you been heading inland from Luskan, east. The birds that relocate south for winter will still be well south of here, so the land will be quiet of birdsong except the night hooting of owls (in between 
+_> 8) hunts).
Your route avoids muskeg (“saragh” in the Realms, “bogs” to many real-worlders) if you keep to the wagon-road. Live and standing dead timber is available in profusion for cook-fire cutting, though you’ll find that 
+_> 9) heavy cutting by wayfarers over the years has pushed the treeline back a good twenty paces from the road-ditches—and that wild raspberries and bracken have colonized this cleared area, often growing so thick and tangled that 
+_> 10) a path must be hewn just to move through. The land is very well-watered, with many tiny rills and brooks running down to fill the ditches (and run along them until the next bridge or culvert in the road lets a larger 
+_> 11) watercourse through; there tends to be at least a culvert between every rise of land the road curves around, and those rises tend to be at most half a mile apart).
This land has been glaciated, so drumlins (humplike hills 
+_> 12) all running in the same general NNE to SSW direction) and eskers (gravel ridges) are everywhere, all overgrown with trees and bushes because the glaciers receded long, long ago.
There are frequent campgrounds (cleared 
+_> 13) solid-ground areas, with a stream nearby) along the trade-road, and even refuse like broken wagon-wheels strewn along the ditches, but everything will be useless-rotten; anything still usable will have already been salvaged 
+_> 14) by someone else.
And bands of hobgoblins, orcs, goblins, and gnolls are just as hungry as everyone else at this time of year, and may be bold enough to skulk along game-trails that overlook the wagon-road, waiting to pounce 
+_> 15) on lone peddlers with pack-mules or other weak-looking travelers (which is why these roads are traveled by almost everyone in caravans, with weapons out and visible, and sentinels are posted during the dark hours, when 
+_> 16) prudent folk camp just off the road rather than pressing on through the night). If you DO hear bird calls, take them for signals between raiders stealing up on you! [2nd half of reply to follow tonight, thanks to power cut & Twitter’s tweet-string limits]

Assuming the duel occurs when Mordenkainen isn’t raving insane, and Telamont doesn’t manage a disabilitating ambush to begin the fight, Mordenkainen would almost certainly mop the floor with Telamont, who is arrogant and far

The besetting fault of the Princes of Shade is their overconfidence/dismissal of everyone else as ‘lesser;’ it’s a weakness that gets them in trouble every time. Experienced beings like the Srinshee and Larloch can often 
+_> 4) easily manipulate senior Thultanthans without necessarily ever having to fight or confront them, just by seeing and exploiting their weaknesses.

Telamont in Barovia would very likely wind up sharing Mordenkainen’s fate and worse, because he’d underestimate the capabilities of not just Strahd, but nigh everyone else he encountered.

?_> [@] I’ve a peculiar query . . I mean moreso than usual I suppose.
In Cormyr: A Novel our old boy B’s Netherese accent is described as chime-like; also across much Realms material the languages and accents of Elves are described using similar terminology/1 
+_> 1)
Sure. Elvish languages have lots of fluid, soft (“S” without a hiss, unless angry) sounds, go up and down in register far more than most human speakers do, ranging over an octave and a half; most humans stay within about six
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) notes, so: the difference between a singer like Enya and an old man singing the Hollywood tune “September Song.” Real-world Puerto Rican speakers have a lot of the darting, swift glissandos elves do (I chose them out of all 
+_> 3) real-world speakers because I can readily add “when speaking English”).
In addition, elven vocal cords can manage two notes at once (the closest most humans can come is to whistle and drone at the same time), which is why I 
+_> 4) speak of chiming like bells (I really mean a two-tone chord, but with a clear tone, and that’s most often heard in our real world when church bells are rung).
Many gamers (not me) reach for a Scottish accent when trying to 
+_> 5) portray dwarves. To me, dwarves may have the burr that some Scots speakers do, but the key characteristic is that they are flat, emphatic speakers: they come down firmly on one note for a syllable. 
+_> 6)
Gnomes are like softer, quieter dwarves, often described as humming or murmuring when heard in the background or at a distance, whereas halflings are high-pitched but soft-spoken, and talk quickly (think a softer version of 
+_> 7) anyone talking their way through the vocal of a patter song, like Gilbert & Sullivan’s “When You're Lying Awake With A Dismal Headache {The Nightmare Song}” from Iolanthe).

If you're using the AD&D system, the DMG specifies the number of charges a given item will have (e.g. for wands, 81-100 charges), and the Book of Artifacts has recharging rules. If you're placing an item for PCs to find as treasure, just decide how many charges 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) are left in the item when found, basing your decision on game balance (item to last for a short time? or to become a relied-upon, long-term weapon?). Some items tell the wielder how many charges are left, some don't but are rechargeable, and some just crumble  
+_> 3) to dust when exhausted. Or have the "dying charge" of an item doing something spectacular and magically chaotic; keep magic mysterious and strange and INTERESTING.

Purebloods are the most human-seeming yuan-ti, and so are most like humans in their eating capacity. However, like some serpents, they can temporarily unhinge their jaws to swallow things that wouldn’t otherwise fit, but if 
+_> 2) they swallow whole (not chewing or masticating, and so not giving their saliva many surfaces to work on, in the ingested material), they end up with lumps in their bodies that are only slowly digested by their stomach acids 
+_> 3) (4-5 days before the yuan-ti needs to defecate; they won’t be hungry for longer, but could force morsels down to ‘pretend to eat’). The digestion includes bones, so they leave little evidence behind, but the swallowing whole 
+_> 4) isn’t fast; if done publicly, the yuant-ti will be seen. And the pelvis, skull, and other large-in-span bones would have to be shattered before swallowing is attempted.

?_> [@] I wonder if you kight enlighten us on some aspects of how you envision cleric magics.
Never mind game mechanics . . they can’t make up their minds . . just TSR & WorC out the window, are clerical spells a standardised language of magic? To clarify 1/ 
+_> 1)
From the beginning of the Realms (pre-D&D), I have always clung to the notion that priests cure by calling on divine power through prayer, and that each faith has its own unique prayers (though for the simplest magics, such as conjuring light or banishing dirt 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) or stains, there might well be 'generic prayers' all deities or their servitors would listen to). As the priest, your fervour/passion and any creative wording (heartfelt) you employ would be heeded, but devout beings are reluctant to stray creatively from the  
+_> 3) prayer wordings they've been taught for fear of the magic failing completely, or even incurring a 'slap' of divine displeasure.
So priests cleave to what they're taught. The wording of a Cure Light Wounds of a priest of Ilmater differs from a priest of Tyr. 
+_> 4)
And yes, regarding kittens and the like ;} I think every faith (and orders of paladins) would have their own differing details of rituals and customs. You CAN heal on the battlefield, but a priestess of Chauntea prefers to heal on a bed of wheat, corn, barley, etc.

Sat Mar 22 21:38:33 (Baldur's Gate, Elturel, Forgotten Realms, Iriaebor, Luskan, Realmslore, Scornubel, Tethyr, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_> Here's a thing about the #ForgottenRealms that's bugged me for 30 years.
See this gap in the road between Dragonspear Castle and Soubar?
It shouldn't exist dnd [:] 
?_> This is the Trade Way. It runs from Luskan in the north all the way to (depending on time period/edition) Amn or Tethyr or Calimport in the south.
There shouldn't be a gap in it.
It's not clear how the gap got on the 1E map, but I long assumed that this passage was responsible: [:] 
?_> "Not considered safe" and "devastated" apparently got interpreted to mean that the road had been wiped out.
But, in point of fact, the road was not actually destroyed and the very next paragraph in the book describes how an army was raised and Dragonspear Castle was sacked. 
?_> (It turns out this is not why the gap exists. See below). 
?_> Another question is what happens between Scornubel and Baldur's Gate.
For a long time, I assumed (based on the map) that the Trade Way actually WAS interrupted here: Trade would come down the road to Scornubel and then take the river to Baldur's Gate before heading south. [:] 
?_> This turns out not to be the case: The Trade Way has always entered Baldur's Gate via the city's north gate.
This would imply that a road must run from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate following the River Chionthar (and various snippets of text support this). 
?_> But here's the odd thing: Elturel is NEVER described as being on the Trade Way, despite the fact that logically it would pass right through the city
In fact, it EXPLICITLY doesn't: [:] 
?_> We'll come back to this. For now, let's go back to the obvious mistake of the missing road between Dragonspear and Soubar. Easy to fix, right?
And it was.
I believe the next map produced was for the Forgotten Realms Atlas, and you can see that the road appears there: [:] 
?_> But there are a couple problems: (1) There's still no road between Elturel and Scornubel, so how does the Trade Way get from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate? (2) There's a new road that cuts south directly from Dragonspear to Baldur's Gate. Why isn't THIS used as the Trade Way? 
?_> In fact, on the map it's shown as a more significant road than the one leading to Soubar.
Let's move forward into 2nd Edition.
At some point this map was produced (it's all over the 'net claiming to be from the revised boxed set), but I can't figure out its actual source: [:] 
?_> You can see it adds some abortive roads north from Baldur's Gate, but otherwise reverts back to the errors of 1st Edition. 
?_> This is what the actual map from the revised Gold Box looks like.
It largely follows the Atlas, except it downgrades the "Coast Way". [:] 
?_> I spent some time trying to figure out how these maps related to each other, but I have come to the conclusion that both the Atlas and the 2nd Edition map are based on a common source: Ed Greenwood's original maps. [:] 
?_> They were apparently displayed at Gamehole Con last year and you can view some photos here: [:] 
?_> Note the lack of a road between Elturel and Scornubel. That's not a production error. [@] didn't have it on his original map.
Again: We'll come back to that. 
?_> Enter 3rd Edition.
This map adds the missing road from Elturel and Scornubel and is probably the most detailed map of the roads in this region to date (although having now done this deep dive, I have quibbles). [:] 
?_> 4th Edition's Faerun map is interesting. It's obviously a regression in terms of detail, but also has a number of glaring inaccuracies. (The road crossing the river far to the east of Baldur's Gate is the most notable.)
We'll mostly ignore this. [:] 
?_> The other notable thing here is that the writers of 4th Edition also wondered why the Trade Way would go all the way east to Scornubel if there was a road heading straight to Baldur's Gate.
Their solution was simple: It doesn't. In 4E, the Trade Way no longer goes to Scornubel. [:] 
?_> Which brings us to 5th Edition.
For 5E's cartography they apparently went back to the original 1E maps. The goal was presumably to sort of "get back to basics," but the result was to reintroduce the errors of the original map.
Including the gap. [:] 
?_> When I started this thread I was primarily aiming to just say, "Hey. Look at that gap!"
But it turns out there's some deeper lore here. 
?_> Specifically, if you do a close reading of the 1E boxed set (which I just did), you'll discover that the entire idea of there being a single "Trade Way" is an illusion.
There was a Trade Way from Amn to Waterdeep: [:] 
?_> But there was another Trade Way, from Waterdeep to Iriaebor. [:] 
?_> And it is this second Trade Way that goes to Scornubel. The reason there's no road from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate (and why Elturel is explicitly not on the Trade Way), is because there IS no Trade Way between Baldur's Gate and Scornubel.
They're two different Trade Ways. 
?_> (My suspicion would be that there were originally many more Trade Ways. These were just the ones that got particular mention in the first boxed set.) 
?_> In the 2nd Edition boxed set, the addition of the "Coast Way" was an attempt to make the difference between the two routes clearer. (For example, in this boxed set, Baldur's Gate is no longer on the Trade Way, it is only on the Coast Way. They are two different things.) 
?_> But I suspect due to all the prominent references to Baldur's Gate being "on the Trade Way" and "the Trade Way follows the coast" that already existed, this became confused. 
?_> In short order, the Coast Way was effectively just another name for the Trade Way. And it was soon explicitly stated to be so, reintroducing the confusion.
E, as noted above, attempted to resolve it by taking Scornubel off the Trade Way. 
?_> (Although incoherently, the same 4e campaign guide still asserted that the Trade Way crossed the Boareskyr Bridge. Which, of course, it cannot possibly do if it's following the road to Baldur's Gate.) [:] 
?_> Of course, this means that there's ANOTHER gap in the Trade Way on the 1E maps. This one between Scornubel and Iriaebor. [:] 
?_> Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be clear solution. This section of the photo of Greenwood's map is difficult to make out details on. And the Atlas, which I think is probably the most accurate representation of Greenwood's original map in print, provides little guidance. [:] 
?_> [@] sure would be nice to hear from [@] on all this. Fascinating find there [@]

And I have lost track of the number of times I've explained this over the years
It's very simple. The dotted lines on my original maps are trails. Wagon roads. Dirt and gravel ruts. The hard lines are flagstone-paved roads with proper bridges, not fords.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Those "gaps" are where the terrain is open fields, and any wagon can take its own route/make its own road. And usually does, to detour around the mud left by earlier wagons. Modern-day urban folk in particular have a very hard time visualizing open prairie  
+_> 3) that's unclaimed by anyone. Open country. It used to exist in our real world. In the Realms, it still does.

George’s “gravitas” was well-chosen, as you’ll see.

So the meltwater lake of Zant’s Folly or Zantmere was created. There was so much ice in the berg that it took some years before it all ran off, sank into the ground, or evaporated.

In the eyes of their deity, they are the same. But a Chosen of any deity but Mystra is "just" an anointed mortal champion of that deity, given powers as the deity wills. As the Weave is all-encompassing and Mystra would have been all-powerful, Ao long ago forced

+_> Murder Hobo Games [@] Question: While there are doubtless many petty rivalries and grudges between noble houses in Waterdeep, are there any that are truly epic in 5E times, say spanning generations?
Thanks as always. 
+_> 1)
There are far too many petty rivalries, grudges, and even outright feuds to list on several Twitters running full-tilt, but one of the most epic is the dispute between House Massalan and House Sultlue. Which has been going on 
+_> 2) for at least two centuries and has resulted (so far) in the deaths of nigh fifty noble folk and over three hundred retainers and hired guards or bullyblade mercenaries. Including six Massalan heirs (at the time of their 
+_> 3) deaths) and one matriarch (Lady Halangalan, in 1253 DR), and seven Sultlue heirs. It involves one all-out assault on the Massalan villa of the time (during which its stables was utterly destroyed and the villa partially 
+_> 4) burned down, in a night-long battle that involved three hired mages and resulted in over a hundred deaths, including neighbors and curious onlookers), one sword-brawl at a noble revel in which two Sultlue heirs 
+_> 5) (Onstlur Sultlue and then his younger brother Braegel) perished in swift succession, and one mercenary dirty-tricks explosion that destroyed House Massalan’s best ornate coach with three family members inside (six servants 
+_> 6) two bodyguards, and half a dozen horses also died; the head of one of the latter was found on a nearby balcony, much to the horror of the old lady who liked to sun herself there). Even today, Massalans and Sultlues bristle at 
+_> 7) the sight of each other, try not to attend the same revels, and turn on heel and leave clubs and eateries if they see members of the other noble house already there (retainers don’t count).
Ere he died (of old age and gout) 
+_> 8) as a ‘wastrel uncle,’ Haerym Massalan was wont to tell anyone who’d listen that the Massalans had “won” the feud, because he’d personally managed a swindle that cost the Sultlues three ships (good cargo cogs, all) and several 
+_> 9) valuable properties in Athkatla. The Sultlues dismissed his claims with scorn, of course, but that didn’t stop them from trying to arrange his “accidental” death at least seventeen unsuccessful times.

No, it's not true. As in: Larloch has a deal with Mystra about what he won't try, so she'll leave him alone.
Larloch has many, many liches serving him, so formidable massed power of arcane magic he can direct. He's also studied more magic, and for longer, than

?_> Ciao Grande Saggio [@] does the Kingdom of Delmyr still exist in the current era? Who is the King? Is the Kingdom always populated by halfling Baronies? Thank you 
+_> 1)
Yes, the kingdom of Delmyr still exists, though in the Spellplague and Sundering it lost two kings, Joroelner Gleddyn and his son Mendaer (and three Gleddyn brothers and their mother, ending the Gleddyn line) in the tumult
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) monsters from Abeir overran the kingdom and were defeated only after decades of hard fighting (as some of those monsters were dragons who chose caverns in the Glittering Spires as ideal places to lair).
Delmyr is currently

+_> 4) assistance in sewing and reaping crops, tending wild growth to yield more wild herbs and medicines and foodstuffs in the future). Initially derided and resisted by the baronial families, who all still exist and cling to their 
+_> 5) power, she has won them all over into staunch support, because all can see she is bettering the lives of all and improving Delmyr.
However, a shadow is rising beneath Delmyr: someone (drow? Illithids? Elminster believes the 
+_> 6) latter) is behind mustering monsters of the Underdark and driving them upwards through the caverns and passages of the Glittering Spires. They have almost eradicated the gnomes, and the supplies of weapons, tools, and wire

The veteran warrior Darthyn Belrowhin leads Delmyr’s too-small army, the Defenders (really a handful of soldiers leading a motley militia).
To make coin for hiring adventurers and mercenaries, Delmyr has begun

?_> [@] Thanks so much, are there any write-ups any where on the Hamlets that you have mentioned aka Forgotten Realms Wiki and maybe maps? 
+_> 1)
I’m afraid not. And if you’re looking for maps, you’re thinking of these hamlets in the wrong way: these are NOT settlements with cleared fields, roads, and so on. They have some clearings, wandering trails overhung by the
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) forest canopy instead of roads (no wagons, just barrows and mule-drag carts), and they have homes that are part caves, part artificial caves (build up a hill of loam and tree stumps, roof it with stones and growing plants so 
+_> 3) roots will anchor it all), part tree-houses (think untidy childrens’ tree forts, reached by rope-ladders and climb-tree ladders, and joined by rope-and-board catwalks), and part tents, with outhouses that get moved when their 
+_> 4) dungpiles are rich and rotted-down enough to serve as gardens for edible forest plants, and so on. In other words, very little that would show up on a map beyond a general location for the hamlet. 
+_> 5)
BTW, a mule-drag cart is a narrow wheelbarrow with long projecting handles, turned backwards and with a mule harnessed between those handles, so the whole thing slopes down to a single wheel at the back. 
+_> 6) (If the wheel breaks, the mule “drags” the thing like a travois, hence the name ‘mule-drag’).

+_> Necessitarian [@] the entrance gift at Candlekeep, does a visitor have to provide one with each visit, or is it only required on the first visit? 
+_> 1)
The first visit only. If a visitor returns with someone else who hasn’t gifted before, the “someone else” must gift Candlekeep with their own acceptable writing. 
+_> 2)
There have been exceptions to the “gift required for admittance” rule: certain rulers, high priests, sages, dragons, a handful of senior Harpers, divine servitors of Oghma and Deneir, and the Chosen of Mystra.

So it is slightly confusing for me that Mystra is a prime god, but the only one that really matters so her Chosen are "the big deal". Seems kind of like Ao would or should maybe fix that instead of causing one Time of Trouble and then slacking off for another few millenia. 
+_> [@] Many mortals lament that the world isn't as they wish it to be, often when bills come due, yet the world seems not to hear or care.
We just don't know enough about Ao to know what he would do. When we say what he "should" do, we merely project our desires onto him.

?_> [@] [@] 
Why would Bane, god of tyranny, seemingly give up his greater god status to become a mortal again just so he could meddle more in mortal affairs? I suppose the same question is true of Bhaal and Myrkul, who have died before too. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] This could be a similar situation to Iuz on Oerth. He was allowed far greater influence on the world because he was on his home plane. He could bring to bear godly might against mortals, while deities who were ostensibly mightier were restricted. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] That could be a possibility, indeed. I guess if I had already been killed before, I’d be a little more cautious about making myself mortal. And Bane just doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who would make himself weaker, to me. But maybe he’s just dumb? 
+_> 1)
Not dumb, but we mortals have seen that Bane is rash, impetuous, and arrogant. He's no patient, long-term schemer, but lives in the present moment (he wants results NOW). And his pride often makes him over-estimate his own prowess, and ignore his own faults.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
However, the fact that all of the Dead Three have elected to stay in the mortal world makes me think they're up to something. Like [@] I think it's a bid for more power. NOT masterminded by Bane, but irresistible to him because he hungers for more power.

No part of my original Realms was based on any direct real-world analogues. (Many designers and DMs have made real-world connections for their own convenience.) Chessenta is a verdant region of many independent city-states, so it could be stretched into a

The Realms is its own world, hopefully NOT a thin copy of ours (or Hollywood-ours).

+_> David G [@] have an untitled Thann adventurer thinking of buying property on southern corner of Scroll Street and Snail Street. He wants to become First Earl of Scroll. Any interesting history about Scroll Street?
Thank you for all you do 
+_> 1)
Sure. Scroll Street got its current name (renamed from Bendulph’s Lane, after the man who began it as a paved cul-de-sac with five buildings for rent (by him, by the room or suite) clustered around it, built on what had been 
+_> 2) his stockyard paddock) when most of the ground-floor shops were rented by scribes, who lived above their shops and hired ‘underscribes’ to work for them at very low wages by throwing in room and board (in the rest of the 
+_> 3) rooms above the shops), so a short stretch of Scroll Street became the locale of choice, if you weren’t a noble or someone else rich enough to summon a scribe to you to do work, for you to find a selection of scribes to 
+_> 4) quickly copy something, draw up a contract or trade agreement in quadruplicate (a copy to each party, plus a temple copy for the temple holding the money, plus a tax-record-remittance copy for the Palace).
So for nigh two 
+_> 5) centuries Scroll Street was a hive of scribes, who earned most of their coin as copyists for daily mercantile trade. (Then and now, it attracts a trickle of interested folk who assume “scroll” means a spell scroll, and magic 
+_> 6) can be bought and sold in Scroll Street. Largely untrue, though it’s correctly rumored many scribes have a handful of spell scrolls they bought as investments, and will sell only for very high prices to the desperate.) 
+_> 7)
Then Scroll Street started to attract some wealthier renters, including mapmakers and bookbinders. The most interesting event it hosted was a band of adventurers arriving to harass a scribe who was secretly a novice mage 
+_> 8) adventurers hired by a creditor. Their violence frightened other scribes living on Scroll Street into sending their fastest family members to call on Watchful Order aid, and the street briefly became a battlefield, in what 
+_> 9) became known as ‘the Shatterbone Fray’ (thanks to various adventurers being hurled forcefully into exterior building walls by various spells, then urged on their way by a chain lightning spell unleashed by an irked wizard 
+_> 10) arriving in the street to buy a blank workbook to record his spellcrafting experiments.
There are also persistent rumors of doppelgangers dwelling among the scribes of Scroll Street (these rumors are true, and the

In the aftermath of the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, the Feywild and the Prime Material Plane (Toril) are closely linked once more, and arcane magic is wild and plentiful and active in the former, and once more stable

+_> 4) fetching something they want for what they guard, that they can’t go and get without abandoning their sworn guard duty), most of them would happily open a way for him.
Failing that, there are locales in the Realms, like 
+_> 5) certain chambers in Silverymoon and Evereska, and ruins such as Spellgard (formerly Saharelgard), where the Feywild and the Prime are very close, and rituals involving as few as three spells, of levels fifth and lower

+_> 7) them. Other places in the Realms would require more powerful and expensive rituals. Some able to perform them would be unwilling to cross Titania; others would delight in doing so, and might even reduce their price to little

Replying to  [@] the same topic, does the mind flayers have to eat the brains of their victims raw, or is there perchance a brisk trade in recipes for the best way to prepare various species' grey matter? 
+_> 1)
If mind flayers want to glean the memories and “deeper” thoughts of their victims, they must devour the brains raw. 
+_> 2)
Strong emotions at the end of life (such as terror) and last ‘surface thoughts’ will survive most cooking processes that don’t involve charring the brain or long marinade periods. So there are brain-preparation recipes, and 
+_> 3) swapping of them, but they are usually used only to enliven illithid ennui, when forced to dine on ‘stupid,’ uninteresting victims. Most mind flayers seek hidden knowledge and unusual memories, and don’t want to miss any.

+_> Matthew Dawkins [@] Well met again! Perhaps you could illuminate for me the main political and cultural differences between Amn and Tethyr, and perhaps regale us with a tale or two of personages who 
+_> . .capitalised on or died because of differences between the two nations. 
+_> 1)
Amn is a mercantile powerhouse, likely still the wealthiest country in all of Faerûn, and is ruled by a Council of the heads of five noble houses: Alibakkar, Dannihyr, Nashivaar, Ophal, and Selemchant, but dominated, as it 
+_> 2) it has always been, by merchant companies and the investments and schemes of individual merchants; “money flows into and out of Amn like the tireless winds and tides,” in the words of the (contemporary) sage Arthlond Laumiir 
+_> 3) of Athkatla. And all of this wealth and the goods underpinning it require guards and bodyguards, so Amn hires many adventurers.
Tied to Amn by a border (still, at their eastern ends) and mutual prosperity, Tethyr is an uneasy 
+_> 4) ally of Amn. A monarchy with a strong nobility, Tethyr has grown steadily in population and wealth and standard of living for the lower classes since its violent civil war, which erupted a century and a half ago and is now 
+_> 5) over but for its population’s deep-seated suspicion of all “meddling outlanders” and just as strong belief that nobles will seize all power if they’re not stubbornly resisted and vigilantly watched.
Amnians fear monsters (due 
+_> 6) to the monster realm of Muranndin) and any strife that hampers mercantile activity and therefore enrichment; Tethyrians know that the worst monsters are untrustworthy neighbors (fellow humans), and fear any threat to their 
+_> 7) threat to their new status quo. Amnians see humans or halflings in a hurry, or dwarves or gnomes hard at work in a workshop or forge, and think “citizens vital to prosperity for all,” whereas Tethyrians seeing the same folk 
+_> 8) will wonder “What are THEY up to, to be in such a hurry, or working so hard?”
Coin is king in Amn; Tethyr has a literal king or queen, and sees royalty and nobility as the familiar “least evil of all necessary evils 
+_> 9)
Several rich merchants of Amn, notably Ladrelas Tranth of Purskul and Jonstal Halavur of Athkatla (both dark-skinned men hailing from Var the Golden, who moved to Amn to make coin), enriched themselves and enabled Tethyr’s 
+_> 10) swift rise to stability and prosperity by quietly bankrolling the most sensible and farsighted Tethyrian nobles, making possible local rebuilding of inns, bridges, roads, and the building of new workshops and warehouses

?_> [@] Hello Ed, I was wondering if their are Orphanages in the Forgotten Realms, example like in Waterdeep, and if so are they mostly tended to by the Temples? How's adoption done in the Realms? 
+_> 1)
I answered this here on Twitter 2 years back:
Almost all of the orphanages in Waterdeep are either temples or guild-run, and located in properties owned by either the various churches or the guilds, respectively. The guilds have traditionally used their orphans
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) as unpaid (but housed, fed, and trained) 'prentices, and although resistance to this in public attitude is rising, ALL of the guilds who have orphanages began them by taking in and rearing the children of guild members who perished (or vanished at sea and 
+_> 3) were presumed dead). Temples also develop clergy and lay temple workers from the ranks of their orphans, but this is far less frowned upon publicly because the public accepts that temples do this (and feed and tend the maimed, the crazed, and the sorely-sick  
+_> 4) and dying; services temple orphans assist in). There aren't many independent/private orphanages in Waterdeep as of the 1490s DR (current 5e Realms time), thanks to some slaving and selling children as food scandals of the past
And as for adoption, laws and  
+_> 5) customs vary widely across the Realms, by realm, race, faith, and past local problems/issues (e.g. slavers operating in the area, or not?). Almost always authorities are involved in the recordkeeping (citizenry rolls), and clergy 'on the ground' in adoptions.

I get asked this a lot, and the answer depends on where (geographically) you are setting your games, and their nature (urban, wilderness, underground). The Sword Coast Adventurers Guide is your 5e baseline, but for more depth and wider geographical coverage, I'd

+_> 1)
Legally, they're the same. However, a royal charter was personally presented to an adventurer (or their group) by a member of the royal family, usually for a personal service (e.g. Florin rescuing the King from a brigand attack). This means instant respect from 
Realmslore [:]

A 'regular' charter is presented  
+_> 3) by a courtier (scribe, clerk, or Crown herald of the Royal Court), and has the royal seal, but lacks a personal royal initial (signed onto the charter by a member of the royal family).

+_> 1)
To many folk of Faerûn distant from the Moonsea region, these are (collectively) “the Mulm Woods,” as they appear thus on early maps.
However, to anyone who lives in the Vast or around the Moonsea (in Mulmaster or Maskyr’s Eye
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) in particular), the woods east of the trade-road are the Reddryn Woods (Mount Reddryn is the most prominent peak of the Earthspurs, due east of this forest, and it’s named for Baerlus Reddryn, a brown-skinned, flame-red 
+_> 3) haired, tall and “spiderlike”-in-build adventurer from Var the Golden who made a heroic last stand against overwhelming numbers of orcs here, and died bloodily but took some sixty orcs with him), and the woods west of the

+_> 5) a-slither with many deadly, hungry vipers; lizardfolk hunting parties later nigh-exterminated these serpents, harvesting them as delicacies, but the name has remained). Some will tell you this forest is named for the 
+_> 6) famous/infamous (depending on one’s point of view) adventurer Jannith Viperfang, “the Lady Fang,” who dwelt in them and fared forth as a brigand and pirate in the 1320s DR, but the truth is she took her name from the trees 
+_> 7) and not the other way around (to conceal her true name, as she was Jandra Bleth, of the Cormyrean noble family of the same name, and didn’t want her parents to know where she’d gone and what she was up to). 
+_> 8) [She was preying in part on Bleth shipments, and wanted to keep her options open to possibly return to Cormyr someday and claim her share of the family riches and lands. Unfortunately, death claimed her first.]

And speaking of which. If Io gave up his body, mind, and soul

In theory, yes. In daily practise, those who aren’t loyal to Shar first and foremost consider the Shadow Weave “of her” and therefore off limits to them unless they become her priests or paladins or fanatical coverts.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
And unless they become that close to Shar, they usually won’t know HOW to access the Shadow Weave. Like Weave-based spells, you must craft the spell properly (incantation, somatic and material component, and your own 
+_> 3) mindset/concentration as caster, during perfect performance of the casting) in order for it to work at all. If you don’t know how to do it “just right,” no access, and (if you’re lucky!) no magic.

As for Io and Sardior: You’re applying LOGIC to matters of faith? Really? Bravo, but so many folk in the Realms don’t, and so worship as they do.
And dragons think not as humans do

The Realms is far more tolerant than our real world “North American modern” when it comes to same gender, trans

And because arranged marriages in any Realms culture or race tend to end up with more unhappy unions than happy 
+_> 6) ones, just about everyone expects people to “grow into a partnership” by living or working or traveling or adventuring together for a time, before a formal wedding (in the Realms, being chaste before marriage is a personal

Among nobles and farmers, because marriage and offspring are so important an element in inheritance

In Waterdeep and Athkatla and other Sword Coast ports, not to 
+_> 11) mention trading cities like Scornubel and Silverymoon, various clubs take the place of hunting lodges and country mansions (unless you’re in the interior of Tethyr); they are the “mixers.” And formal courtship largely takes 
+_> 12) place at feasts and revels held during local annual festivals.
For a noble, formal courtship may include dancing with someone in front of their family, then dancing with various family members (and enduring their queries or 
+_> 13) judgments/revelations of their personal expectations of the suitor, during the dance), then going on a hunt together (and, yes, there have been “hunting accidents” where disapproving family members frighten off, disable, or 
+_> 14) even “take care of” an unwanted suitor).
The only thing that really stands out for same-gender couples in courtship is buying underwear and everyday tools/flatware/“little things” for each other; differing-gender couples tend 
+_> 15) to confine such gifts to scents, books, and hats and cloaks.

?_> Something interesting I noticed -- the symbol of the Queen of Air and Darkness is a black diamond. In 2e, 3e, and D&D Next Auril's symbol was a snowflake on a black diamond. In 4e it was said Auril was the QoAaD. In 5e they're separate, and Auril's symbol is *just the snowflake 
?_> An interesting vein to explore for any characters for whom Auril or the QoAaD are important, perhaps - especially if the QoAaD still claims to be Auril to retain worshippers on Toril.
Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it's an interesting notion. Any thoughts, [@] deeds of gods are often mysteries to mortals, especially when overlaid by what priesthoods say (which is often propaganda/misdirection intended to make their deity seem important/vital).
In this case, I'd say this: "The QoAaD still claims to be Auril to

Some believe he then went to Waterdeep or Silverymoon, others to the Dales, and still others think he changed gender permanently and dwelt quietly in Cormyr, raising chickens.

As for why he went shopping: he liked to eat dishes that were heavy on garlic, mushrooms, and leeks all fried in wines. Courtiers hated the smell he exuded and breathed, and avoided preparing said dishes; so when in the mood, he bought and cooked for himself 
+_> 7)
Lore Lord of the Realms George Krashos has rescued me, pointing out quite rightly that Tahandral would have been "Pasha" of Calimport, not "Syl-Pasha" (the Syl-Pasha of Calimshan at the time was Kamar yn Saban el Djenispool).

Tue Apr 01 19:07:48 (Forgotten Realms, Gargauth, Kossuth, Realmslore, Red Wizards, Thay)

?_> [@] Hi Ed! I'm currently running a Forgotten Realms campaign set in Thay (which is among my favourite stomping grounds) and [@] is playing a former house slave adopted into a noble Thayvian family. The Alemok family hasn't taken her in out of altruism, (cont.) 
+_> 1)
In general, slaves in Thay are expensive, valuable commodities, considered by most owners to be inherently more loyal than free, middle-class Thayans because they have to be; there’s no place for them to survive in Thayan
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) society if they aren’t, and a wise owner rewards good behavior and achievement so a slave sees clear benefit in ‘being good.’ So slaves get training to become the practical hands-on experts an owner needs (gem polisher 
+_> 3) cook, smith, vintner, etc.).
In the case of this former house slave, she would be a ‘house treasure’ if she’s good at the Art and can be developed into a powerful mage. They would indeed get her a bodyguard, and try to keep 
+_> 4) all word of her talent utterly quiet. If she did any spellcasting training, they’d want it to be in a private cavern or a very secluded outdoor spot far from habitation, to keep anyone else from seeing it. They’d not speak 
+_> 5) of her training, or her at all, where non-family members and non-their-household staff could hear. And for her tutors, they’d likely hire outlander wizards or renegade Red Wizards outcast for past indiscretions (or, far more 
+_> 6) often, being on the losing side in some internal power struggle or other), and preferably the former, to cut down on the chances of word getting out and around in Thayan society. As the Alemoks generally lack aptitude for 
+_> 7) the Art, the former house slave is a treasure beyond price to them. She will herself be watched, of course, to make sure she doesn’t use her developing skills against the family, or ally or befriend others who might be family 
+_> 8) rivals or whom she might confide in, and so on (in other words, her bodyguard will be keeping her apart from most public contact).
Adroit segue to discussion of that bodyguard. Barbarians are viewed in two ways: dangerous 
+_> 9) disposable fodder (and to a Thayan noble, anyone at all who’s not a Thayan noble or a powerful mage or a cleric is a barbarian), and useful but expendable tools, if they can take a modicum of training. A former gladiator 
+_> 10) slave is obviously in the second group, and therefore his or her position now is perfectly understandable (even to someone who has no idea that the recruited barbarian is the former house slave’s bodyguard, and just think 
+_> 11) he or she is an Alemok family bodyguard, guarding the former house slave because she’s a family asset currently considered useful/worth guarding for some reason—and it might be something so mundane as being in training to 
+_> 12) be a good cook, when the family only has lousy ones, or being trained to be a gemcutter and polisher when the family has had to overpay for outside third parties to do such services for them).
A barbarian running around 
+_> 13) loose is a peril to be slain, or captured and enslaved, but a barbarian who’s obviously a slave and therefore the property of a Thayan house (i.e. wearing harness with an Alemok badge or livery) would be assumed to be 
+_> 14) working for the house if not running amok and attacking random folk in public, and would be accepted for that and not even arouse much interest, unless they were themselves visually interesting or doing something interesting 
+_> 15) (like carrying a sheep on either shoulder, or a struggling trussed human).
This barbarian-heritage bodyguard would be most likely to venerate Malar or Kossuth (or, if he or she has worked as a a soldier, Helm) as patron 
+_> 16) deities, but could have Gargauth as a patron if they feel ‘apart’ and ill-regarded in Thayan society, Loviatar if he or she is sadistic or masochistic, and even Shar if they want Thayan society to come crashing down 
+_> 17) and be swept away.

In his sane moments, Halaster considers himself unique (hence his adoption of a new name, moving away from “Hilather”) rather than seeing himself as an Imaskari survivor. As a creator of many, many spells over the years

Halaster swears under his breath to himself in Rashoum when shocked or taken aback. He never hums except, on very rare

Hi, [@] how you been? Hope you're doing well.
I have a Neverwinter question: besides the Tschavarz (that are mentioned in the Cold Steel and Secrets novella) and the Neverembers, which other noble families live in Neverwinter around 1480 DR? 
+_> Jon Gomez [@] · Feb 25
Did the Babrises (from the Drizzt Neverwinter novels) survive the destruction of the city?
I hope you can help me with this one! 
+_> 1)
Yes, all of the Babrises survived what befell Neverwinter.
As of 1480 DR, no* noble families make their collective homes, or bases, in Neverwinter, but there are more than a dozen individual nobles (including some from 
+_> 2)
Waterdhavian families) resident in the city. They keep low profiles, not ostentatiously spending or riding about in coaches with servants as outriders or hosting large public revels, and not even using their titles in 
+_> 3) public, for fear that Dagult Neverember will decide Neverwinter isn’t big enough to hold nobles aside from himself (potential rivals). In other words, these dozen-some nobles don’t publicly dip so much as a finger in matters 
+_> 4) political.
They include Eltarr Roaringhorn (of the Waterdeep AND Suzail Roaringhorns), Belthrond Thione (of the Tethyrian Thiones, or so he claims; some doubt his lineage), and of longtime families of Neverwinter considered 
+_> 5) noble: Ammacastur Thaland, Melarra Yysabroe (a widow) and her teenaged daughters Immeira and Daunchalace, and the patrician, dabbler-in-investments (and quite possibly as tough and devious a man as Neverember) Teladror Melvaeraghost.

The use of unreliable narrators builds in a canon, in-game justification for DM creativity/changes, which in turn returns the game to a roleplaying experience, not an "insider-trading advantage" experience.

?_> [@] Westgate is on a peninsula, and economically it's an important port town between the west and the east (or the inland and the Sea of Fallen Stars). What confuses me is why the city has so many gates in all directions, even though land trade comes and goes West. 
?_> The Grand Ride is the only major road leading into and out of Westgate. Azure Bonds and the Forgotten Realms Atlas seem to suggest the Grand Ride curls around the Hills of the Seven Lost Gods and then meets up with the South Gate, so where do the other gates lead? 
+_> 1)
While it's true that there has always been travel to and from farms in the land around the city, the majority of such gates, as with all walled cities in the Heartlands, is to allow ready access to livestock paddocks well outside the walls (for "let's get away 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) from the stink" reasons); the paddocks exist for daily "feeding the city" needs, and more importantly, to let wagons, beasts of burden, local cargo carts, and people ready access to fields where caravans assemble and disperse. Westgate's location at the end  
+_> 3) of the Grand Ride means fourteen or more caravans could be gathering or dispersing at any one time, outside the walls (no room INSIDE), and being as the city wants to not be at the mercy of a caravan coster or trading company forcibly establishing a monopoly  
+_> 4) by just occupying all the mustering space, it's in their interest to have multiple gates so no one player can dominate, and always has been. So: many city gates.

Ao cut off access through the Weave to spells above a certain power level (9th level in Torilian arcane magic terms) after the Folly of Karsus the over-reaching mortal. This means that more powerful spells fail upon casting

There are rituals and magic systems that don’t use the Weave, but the archmagi, covens of witches or hags, cabals of warlocks, and so on DO use the Weave in their rituals. Like the transplanted-to-Abeir wizards of Toril I 
+_> 4) mentioned in my earlier lore reply, such individuals would have to learn, or invent, an entire new system of magic to circumvent the Weave, and this would be hard for them without an expert tutor, because what they’re used

So, yes, the sides are climbable (with some danger), and goat-track paths zig-zag up those sides to reach

?_> [@] [@] [@] Does anyone have an idea on the spice trade across Faerûn? My players are taking Trollskull Tavern a bit too far XD. 
+_> 1)
Ormpur on the Shining Sea coast (S of the Border Kingdoms) is the City of Saffron. Spices tend to be harvested, used, and sold locally, but as with our real world historically, there are a few spices that, like saffron, are in high demand but available only from 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) too few places of origin. Which is a long-winded way of saying there is a significant, high-value spice trade overland, and from the POV of someone on the Sword Coast, that means spices come from "afar" (way, way south or way, way east) to the Sword Coast. 
+_> 3)
A local-to-western Faerûn storehouse-center for the spice trade is the island of Tharsult. Pages 88-89 of the 3rd Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign setting (the big baseline Realms book) have a trade-flows map, with Salt and Spices marked (salt mined in Samarach  
+_> 4) and spices shipped north from the Tashalar (mainly to Tharsult for transshipment elsewhere) and north from Calimshan into Tethyr (and thence, elsewhere). Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Athkatla, and Calimport are all cities on the Sword Coast where you can buy  
+_> 5) the full array" of spices used by most humans, demihumans, and humanoids, with regular resupplies. So are Silverymoon, Scornubel, Crimmor, and Iriaebor except in the depths of winter when caravans don't run.

Heh. This was actually officially decided back in the early TSR days. They wanted it not to be in Toril, but I pointed out we already had printed lore of "hempen" ropes, woven bags, etc. Sooooo various plants exist, their uses and prep are jealously-guarded 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) herbalist/temple "secrets," cannabis has almost no effect on dwarves and gnomes, none at all on halflings, is nothing more than a painkiller for orcs, and makes elves violently ill (cramps, vomiting, feels like their blood is on fire). So most folk in the  
+_> 3)
Realms employ other (fantastical/invented; see the Amarune's Almanacs on DM's Guild for a LOT of invented flora of the Realms) plants for recreational or even soothing purposes. Cannabis and several invented plants slow blood-flow, clear the head, and quell  
+_> 4) nausea. Most of my invented plants require the presence in a concoction (drink or poultice) or mix (line a pipe bowl with one, then smoke the other in the pipe) to derive hallucinations, or euphoria, or pain-free bliss. [Of course, none of this was published.] 
+_> 5)
Whoops! Almost forgot your last question: almost all of these plants grow wild everywhere in the temperate zone of Faerûn (= the Heartlands), but there are a few (e.g. Quilaeya/"the Desert Flower") that grow in Raurin and other southern and eastern arid regions.

Oh, just one more thing (channeling my inner Columbo): the various creatures known as "hags" know all about the many uses of various plants, and make extensive use of this. My hag lairs are full of trap-bladders that release gases on intruders.

I was looking at the Lands of Intrigue sourcebook, specifically the Topographical map that came with it. The tallest mountains that i could find were 5000 feet.
Thanks!

So far as Elminster knows, the tallest mountain is Cloudspire (so named because its peak is permanently shrouded in a cloud layer) in the Yehimal range. If you look at Karen Wynn Fonstad’s most relevant map from the FR Atlas
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) find the label “Kun-Yen Shan,” and go due south from the ‘e’ in that label to the high ridgeline she drew in the green central peaks area, the peak right where your eyeline intersects that ridgeline is Cloudspire. Also known 
+_> 3) as Arthael to the elves, Yavalaur to the gnomes, Yauvdagh to the dwarves, and (Cloudspire being the Common Tongue name) variously to humans as Dzayur, Mount Huul, and Kulmount.
Cloudspire has little mineral wealth, but a few 
+_> 4) interior caverns, which have been the lairs of several dragons until remorhaz moved in and started a family (there are now many, and they use high valleys in the Yehimal range to farm wild herds of rothé and musk oxen and

There are several. Erin Evans is THE expert on Tymantheran (as well as an author EVERYONE should read, Realms fan or not), and she’s given us these terms:
Kosjmyrni = a dragonborn raised by his mother’s clan

Strixicki = a pejorative term for the dragonborn (literally “little imposters”)
Thrikominaki = a dragonborn who is clanless
Vayemniri = the dragonborn of Tymanchebar

And in ‘standard’ Draconic, the collective impolite term for dragonborn is “darathric” (= no-dragon)
And the collective polite term for dragonborn is “darahar” (=echo-dragon) [“har” = echo, and hlar = roar]

?_> [@] all the recent discussions of Chosen and other gods’ chosens makes me wonder something tangential:
Godly tampering.
For blessing or curse, gift or custom generated Champion . . I imagine it’s quite rare but do the gods have the power to make a birth happen? /1 
+_> 1)
The answer is yes, gods can bring about unlikely or otherwise impossible births. Usually to 'mold' Chosen or prepare backup future host bodies. However, it's VERY rarely done because it costs (permanently lost) a small amount of divine power, and because unless 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) the deity wants to just waste that power, the rearing of a "godborn" takes a lot of time, attention, and effort. And any godborn is a juicy target for rival deities. So it's done only as part of "long game" elaborate strategies, not out of Zeus-like lust.

Mon Mar 24 06:01:35 (Baldur's Gate, Elturel, Forgotten Realms, Iriaebor, Luskan, Realmslore, Scornubel, Tethyr, Waterdeep)

?_> Here's a thing about the #ForgottenRealms that's bugged me for 30 years.
See this gap in the road between Dragonspear Castle and Soubar?
It shouldn't exist dnd [:] 
?_> This is the Trade Way. It runs from Luskan in the north all the way to (depending on time period/edition) Amn or Tethyr or Calimport in the south.
There shouldn't be a gap in it.
It's not clear how the gap got on the 1E map, but I long assumed that this passage was responsible: [:] 
?_> "Not considered safe" and "devastated" apparently got interpreted to mean that the road had been wiped out.
But, in point of fact, the road was not actually destroyed and the very next paragraph in the book describes how an army was raised and Dragonspear Castle was sacked. 
?_> (It turns out this is not why the gap exists. See below). 
?_> Another question is what happens between Scornubel and Baldur's Gate.
For a long time, I assumed (based on the map) that the Trade Way actually WAS interrupted here: Trade would come down the road to Scornubel and then take the river to Baldur's Gate before heading south. [:] 
?_> This turns out not to be the case: The Trade Way has always entered Baldur's Gate via the city's north gate.
This would imply that a road must run from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate following the River Chionthar (and various snippets of text support this). 
?_> But here's the odd thing: Elturel is NEVER described as being on the Trade Way, despite the fact that logically it would pass right through the city
In fact, it EXPLICITLY doesn't: [:] 
?_> We'll come back to this. For now, let's go back to the obvious mistake of the missing road between Dragonspear and Soubar. Easy to fix, right?
And it was.
I believe the next map produced was for the Forgotten Realms Atlas, and you can see that the road appears there: [:] 
?_> But there are a couple problems: (1) There's still no road between Elturel and Scornubel, so how does the Trade Way get from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate? (2) There's a new road that cuts south directly from Dragonspear to Baldur's Gate. Why isn't THIS used as the Trade Way? 
?_> In fact, on the map it's shown as a more significant road than the one leading to Soubar.
Let's move forward into 2nd Edition.
At some point this map was produced (it's all over the 'net claiming to be from the revised boxed set), but I can't figure out its actual source: [:] 
?_> You can see it adds some abortive roads north from Baldur's Gate, but otherwise reverts back to the errors of 1st Edition. 
?_> This is what the actual map from the revised Gold Box looks like.
It largely follows the Atlas, except it downgrades the "Coast Way". [:] 
?_> I spent some time trying to figure out how these maps related to each other, but I have come to the conclusion that both the Atlas and the 2nd Edition map are based on a common source: Ed Greenwood's original maps. [:] 
?_> They were apparently displayed at Gamehole Con last year and you can view some photos here: [:] 
?_> Note the lack of a road between Elturel and Scornubel. That's not a production error. [@] didn't have it on his original map.
Again: We'll come back to that. 
?_> Enter 3rd Edition.
This map adds the missing road from Elturel and Scornubel and is probably the most detailed map of the roads in this region to date (although having now done this deep dive, I have quibbles). [:] 
?_> 4th Edition's Faerun map is interesting. It's obviously a regression in terms of detail, but also has a number of glaring inaccuracies. (The road crossing the river far to the east of Baldur's Gate is the most notable.)
We'll mostly ignore this. [:] 
?_> The other notable thing here is that the writers of 4th Edition also wondered why the Trade Way would go all the way east to Scornubel if there was a road heading straight to Baldur's Gate.
Their solution was simple: It doesn't. In 4E, the Trade Way no longer goes to Scornubel. [:] 
?_> Which brings us to 5th Edition.
For 5E's cartography they apparently went back to the original 1E maps. The goal was presumably to sort of "get back to basics," but the result was to reintroduce the errors of the original map.
Including the gap. [:] 
?_> When I started this thread I was primarily aiming to just say, "Hey. Look at that gap!"
But it turns out there's some deeper lore here. 
?_> Specifically, if you do a close reading of the 1E boxed set (which I just did), you'll discover that the entire idea of there being a single "Trade Way" is an illusion.
There was a Trade Way from Amn to Waterdeep: [:] 
?_> But there was another Trade Way, from Waterdeep to Iriaebor. [:] 
?_> And it is this second Trade Way that goes to Scornubel. The reason there's no road from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate (and why Elturel is explicitly not on the Trade Way), is because there IS no Trade Way between Baldur's Gate and Scornubel.
They're two different Trade Ways. 
?_> (My suspicion would be that there were originally many more Trade Ways. These were just the ones that got particular mention in the first boxed set.) 
?_> In the 2nd Edition boxed set, the addition of the "Coast Way" was an attempt to make the difference between the two routes clearer. (For example, in this boxed set, Baldur's Gate is no longer on the Trade Way, it is only on the Coast Way. They are two different things.) 
?_> But I suspect due to all the prominent references to Baldur's Gate being "on the Trade Way" and "the Trade Way follows the coast" that already existed, this became confused. 
?_> In short order, the Coast Way was effectively just another name for the Trade Way. And it was soon explicitly stated to be so, reintroducing the confusion.
E, as noted above, attempted to resolve it by taking Scornubel off the Trade Way. 
?_> (Although incoherently, the same 4e campaign guide still asserted that the Trade Way crossed the Boareskyr Bridge. Which, of course, it cannot possibly do if it's following the road to Baldur's Gate.) [:] 
?_> Of course, this means that there's ANOTHER gap in the Trade Way on the 1E maps. This one between Scornubel and Iriaebor. [:] 
?_> [@] [@] please help! 
+_> [@] [@] You must have missed my explanation:
Flagstone paved roads with bridges are solid lines on maps, trails/wagon roads are dotted lines (even on real-world topo maps). See my original maps; the "missing" roads are all there. No need for more than trails on open prairie.

Thu Jan 24 20:38:32 (Netherese, Realmslore, Suzail, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_> Wondering: Can a player character speak Netherese?
Could you build a character who knew it from the get go, or would they need to study it? If so how long would it take to learn and where would they have to go in order to get the material?
Maybe [@] can help? #dnd #dnd5e 
+_> 1)
In the Realms of the 1300s and 1400s DR, only characters who grew up or dwelt (for a year or more, to get all the nuances) in a Netherese city or enclave would speak Netherese. Everyone else would have to learn it.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
The basics could be learned from the libraries of Candlekeep or Derlusk or the Royal Palace in Suzail or certain nobles’ libraries in Waterdeep, and a few other places, but not the nuances (they require a lot of ongoing speech 
+_> 3) with those fluent in Netherese). Nuances include idioms, when phrases have double meanings or are used to convey an unspoken subtext of opinion (example: saying someone is “one of the best” in a way that conveys sarcasm 
+_> 4) sarcasm or “not really, just being polite” without using intonation). Someone who’s mastered the basics could communicate haltingly, like a traveler using individual words or phrases from a traveler’s phrasebook, but everyone

Any descendants of Netherese who retained elements of the language in local dialect would be like a “basics” struggling traveler.

?_> [@] [@] Were they working after the spellplague and either before or after the second sundering would any Netherese spell scrolls with chronomancy spells work? If so they could be worth a small fortune 
+_> 1)
Such scrolls have always been rare and valauble, but since the onset of the Spellplague, the effects of casting a time-related spell except those that cause stasis have been random and wildly unpredictable.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Usually they cause an unforeseen “side effect.” No ‘going back in time’ effort ever seems to work, except as far as back to the moment when the casting of the chronomancy spell commenced.

?_> Another thing that's hitting me as I dig through five editions of Forgotten Realms material is how very, vitally important a living world bible and reference system is; because it's really clear that those aren't things TSR or Wizards have. It's retcons all the way down. #DnD 
?_> [@] I wonder if there was some sort of bible at the beginning, when Forgotten Realms was adopted by the company; whether Ed Greenwood was there at the beginning, and the larger the whole thing got, the more others just added to it, and it all just sprawled out of control. 
?_> [@] From what I understand, and if I'm wrong, [@] please correct me, is that when he sold it, it was in multiple boxes of notebooks, files, and loose-leaf paper, there wasn't a condensed world bible. He was there, but in a writing/advisory role, and didn't have final say. 
+_> 1)
Correct. For weeks in 1986, I typed up weekly packages on topics Jeff Grubb asked me to cover, and FexEx'd them off to TSR (yes, this was before a usable Internet, folks). Photocopied them all for reference to guard against loss (and there is one package that's 
Realmslore [:]

+_> 3) when TSR wanted to interest Hollywood in the various settings, to inform a complete novice about what the Realms was. And, yes, I never wanted any part of the Realms to be a close real-world analogue, but as TSR wanted it to host specific types of play (pirate

So if you 'mispronounce' something, you're just sounding like SOMEONE in the Realms.
Jeff Grubb and I came up with that idea right away, because TSR folks in the same building all used their own pronunciations for the same Realms names.

The player of a barbarian can also choose to end rage on the character’s turn

Certainly. Anything I write about the Realms, by definition, is canon, unless or until contradicted/rendered out-of-date by Wizards-published writing. That's in the original Realms agreement, that Wizards inherited from TSR; Wizards can't change the agreement

I know some fans like to decide for themselves what's canon or not, in any IP, but no one but players in my home Realms campaign would have seen more than DRAGON-glimpses of the Realms without the agreement, so it's the baseline for FR canon.

?_> [@] Wait unknown, is it because something interferes with divination spells? Other than local critters eating said diviners. 
+_> 1)
Properly handled by the DM, all divinations will result in somewhat cryptic answers (to prevent it being the "accomplish everything with no effort" spell). In this case, the cloud cover foils vision/line of sight spells, and the gods not caring about a peak's 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) height, so they don't know it and can't be bothered to find out is a big reason. Measuring is hard for mortals and gods, because the land around Cloudspire is all high mountain range; where do you measure FROM? We real-worlders use sea level as "zero" and  
+_> 3) measure up from there, by triangulation and satellites and so on that gods in the Realms neither know nor care about. Divination can only tell you what a god wants you to know, and sometimes a mortal query will be met by a divine shrug.

+_> Vanessa Pederson [@] hope you are recovering well. You recently answered some questions about Dagult November and I was wondering if you happen know how he feels about his son Renaer or if he has any plans concerning him? 
+_> 1)
As seen in Steven Schend’s novel BLACKSTAFF TOWER, Dagult and Renaer don’t get along well. Renaer (who joined the Harpers) disapproved of his father’s methods and treatment of people, and Dagult was deeply disappointed 
+_> 2) in Renaer for being “disloyal” (=not a tool who’d obey his father and help carry out his schemes without qualm or hesitation). Dagult hoped, when Renaer was a young child, to gain him as a trustworthy henchman, but abandoned 
+_> 3) all such plans when he saw that Renaer wasn’t just a ‘rebellious teen, defying parents because that’s what teens do,’ but put foolish morals and scruples above loyalty to family, elders, and his father in particular.

Depends on the weather, strength of prevailing winds and currents (which vary by time of year AND weather elsewhere), and what you’re sailing (sail area, hull drag; caravel faster than cog or nao, costal raker faster still).
Realmslore [:]

?_> [@] I have a question. I've talked to several different DMs and they always just laugh and shrug or say my characters wont run into that kind of situation. Anyway. Is it possible for an ice brand like Drizzt's Icingdeath for instance, nullify spellfire, or be consumed? 
+_> [@] The Weave (Mystra) is a way of harnessing the raw energies of the world. Divine fire & Mystra's silver fire are focused distillates of these energies; spellfire is less-focused raw world energy (so, all-ravaging fire. An ice brand will be consumed, its magic absorbed.

Misuse" of magic, to Mystra, is to oppress others with it, so those who use magic end up hated or feared, and/or to deny the use of magic to others (i.e. a wizard or ruler seizing magic items from commoners or others). Anything that works against magic for 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) all, EXCEPT to curb the actions of oppressors who use magic to oppress, or who act to restrict others having or using magic, is "misuse" of magic, to Mystra. So Red Wizards or Zhentarim working tyranny through magic is bad; giving or trading magic items is not.

+_> [@] I'd love to see such a tome! As with food in the Realms, I've had lore about music in the Realms since before there was anything called D&D, and it's grown over the years since many gamers and readers fell in love with the Realms and added lore or asked me questions.

Warlocks making pacts with primordials? Possibly, but that means they might differ from Torilian warlocks, or might not exist at all.

?_> [@] [@] I'm all for inclusivity and diversity, but I truly hope (at the risk of sounding profoundly ignorant here) they don't change the *history* of the Realms. For example, Drow are historically evil because they indoctrinate(d) themselves to be from the day they're born. 
?_> [@] [@] If the drow have a sort of "moral renaissance", I think that would be awesome, and I'm especially excited for what that might entail for Lolth and the Seldarine, but please don't redact the lore and stories I grew up with and love. Make it a progressive thing, not retroactive. 
+_> [@] [@] The "standing Realms rule" is: rules/edition/real-world changes don't change established lore; "what came before" is still the history of the Realms.
As it should be; if we erase or rewrite the past, we learn nothing, and past achievements and strivings are nothing.

Guilds function within local laws, but otherwise by their own rules, so they vary a lot.

Too many 'S' apocalypses!

He is answering the prayers of the faithful, granting spells to clergy, and in fact did so with far shorter an interruption during the Spellplague than most other

The iconography you cite sounds very much like Shar or Entropy, but hijacking a shrine is Not Done, and I suspect Ao will sharply curb any interloper deity doing so (loss of divine reach or power) before long.

Best” depends on your purpose: best for the hin would likely be siting it near Starmantle (or a tad further east along the same coast, into Turmish), flipping it north/south to keep the seacoast where it is. This would give

If you sacrifice the seacoast, the Five Shires will fit in several places along the Heartlands trade routes, such as in the Greenfields, or in The Shining Plains or along the shores of Shalane Lake. Or it could

+_> 1)
This was during the "Satanic panic" days, when TSR was mindful of preachers thundering about "witchcraft" and "demons and devils" being in the game, and Angry Mothers From Heck forbidding their kids buying or playing D&D. So having DRUG USE in the game was, yes, a red flag [:]

They are. The Church of Myrkul has been ever thus. He wants his clergy not to be attacked and exterminated (he has few enough, as it is), so he wants people to fear what can happen if you attack a priest of Myrkul, and fear HIM. Fear=respect. But if they were

?_> Does anyone have a good resource for Neverwinter Wood? [@] [@]  [@] 
Specifically what plants, animals, and dangers lie within. Not really the history or humanoid inhabitants #dnd #faerun #forgottenrealms #dnd5e 
?_> [@] [@] [@] In Amarune's Almanac, we list Blueleaf, Duskwood, Muskcap, and Shadowtop for unique flora in Neverwinter Wood. The proximity to Mount Hotenow and the Crags likely makes it a place where Abeirwood could flourish, and inevitably there is likely Ironwood here too. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] The Fey presence post-Spellplague probably brought some even more magical flowers and plants to Neverwinter Wood as well. Almost definitely, Sgiafruit Bloom (apple trees that grow a brand of apple that Nathair Sgiathatch loves in his apple pies) and some other more exotic plants 
?_> [@] [@] [@] In terms of Fauna, there are undoubtably most anything you'd find in a Northern forest - furred mammals like Foxes, Wolves, Bears, Mountain Cats.
We talk about Goreboars, Moss Bears, and Redwood Crawlers in AA. Kermode Bears and White Stags definitely could be found here, too. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Due to the events in 1451 DR with Maegera and Mount Hotenow, the area near there is scorched earth - teeming with Fire Elementals, Fire Giants, Fire Bats, Red Dragons, and other creatures drawn to the inhospitable environment. This poses a constant threat to the Wood. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] The Neverwinter River entrance to the Wood, and its proximity to the Bluffs, would be a hospitible environment for some coastal-flora as well such as Culdewort, Elengur, Felver, Flotsam Fungus, Garlghast, Mammurth, Jassym, and Sword Ivy 
?_> [@] [@] [@] While not native to Neverwinter Wood, Claugiyliamatar the Ancient Green Dragon who lairs in Kryptgarden travels between Waterdeep and Neverwinter, and has agents in both places. It's very likely she has a secondary temporary lair hidden in or around the Wood, away from Reds. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Lastly (for me), the Eladrin of Iliyanbruen have been attempting to re-establish the ruins of the lost city of Sharandar post-Spellplague, so that's a danger for sure. Sharandar is said to be full of riches, so if it was re-established, it'd draw the attention of treasure seekers

The Realms is a "magic-rich" setting; and my answer applies to it only.
If magic use is rarer, its wielders become more valuable, so either more powerful, or pawns/prisoners if other factors (lots of ancient magic items, in the hands of rulers?) make that possible.

Dear [@] , can you help me with a situation that might happen in a future adventure? My players' characters will be hired to retrieve a magic item from an old, forgotten complex that once belonged to priests of Bhaal. This subterranean complex has an underground  temple and a crypt where assassins and Bhaalist priests were buried. So, let's say that some PCs decide to oven the tombs. Some bodies have riches (jewelry, coins, a few +1 daggers) with them. What if they pillage these tombs? What will be the consequences? The campaign
Takes place in 1357 DR, and Bhaal is alive and kicking. Will they incur the wrath of the Lord of Murder somehow? Will some kind of course befall on them? Sorry for the long question and thanks for your help! 
+_> [@] No curse, but if all tomb weapons will be "murder blades" (once unsheathed, can't go into any scabbard until they've taken a life; if dispel magic is applied, they explode in a vicious shrapnel burst: shards carry fatal contact poison (that was INSIDE the weapons).

?_> Hi [@] ! As a DM, did you ever use "madness rules" and monsters that can make you mad ? (For example, a game session "I have to go to a temple because my character has gone mad since I've deen this weird monster") Thanks ! 
+_> [@] Yes, but not madness tables, though I've designed some for previous edition official D&D. I have specific sorts of insanity caused by specific things (poison, magic, psionic attacks, etc.). Insanity and poisons tend to get edited out of the game, and later replaced.

Yes, but all races in the Realms have a variety of localized names they call themselves; it's rarely race-wide, and most half-races don't have a collective self-term; different individuals prefer different words. And these are all different from the terms other races use [:]

I’m not sure if Elminster enjoys traveling; it’s hard to tell when he’s as crotchety as he is, most of the time. And he doesn’t tell me or anyone where and when he goes places (for security reasons, you understand)

That seems like a continuity error. Goddess of magic with no limiter or handicap still can't make gods or overturn their decrees unless she takes over their portfolio, which Ao wouldn't allow anyway. So could even make it so magic doesn't need a god to run it. 
+_> [@] Hmm. You seem to be understanding quite a different Realms than the one we see in print. In which many gods have seized or stolen the portfolios of others, or even slain other gods and Ao did nothing.
No one really understands Ao, or what he'll allow or not.

?_> [@] I'm sure you've been asked this question before, but when it comes to the novels, was there a collaboration of authors or a sole visionary responsible for guiding the world-encompassing events like the Spellplague and the Sundering? 
+_> [@] The Spellplague was an in-house decision, to 'jump' the timeline about a century, so previous lore products didn't have to be kept in print.
The (Second) Sundering was a big collaborative effort of authors and designers, meeting at secret summits. GREAT fun!

?_> [@] Bruenor Battlehammer gave the throne to his cousin. Connerad Brawnanvil gave it to his general. What is the official way for dwarves kings to give their throne? 
+_> [@] There isn't one.
Or rather, so many different things have happened, down the years, that no succession is firm.
Key for dwarves: a king's eldest child can't succeed without clan support, so a dolt or bully or just unpopular offspring isn't guaranteed a crown.

+_> [@] Hmmm. I don't base places in the Realms on real-world places, or even Hollywood places, though some designers have. But the general accents of Common as spoken in the Vilhon are fluid, with many soft sounds, S sounds, and rushes of several words nigh strung together.

?_> Hi [@] ! Do the dwarves have "archives" or "records" of some sort in their fortress ? What could be recorded in it and under which written form ? (I'm planning a dwarf library/archive room but don't really know what to fill it with. 
+_> [@] See my long-ago Runestones article in THE DRAGON. A typical dwarf library will have stone wall-shelves (and niches under flagstones underfoot) full of runestone 'books' and records. Stones graven in Dethek.

+_> [@] The EASIEST way of making a flying city was to shear through the top of a mountain, magically bind the rocks of this "tip" together, and use it as a base, but far more Netherese archwizards "followed their own weird" than took the easy way.

+_> [@] [@] [@] Yes, but VERY slowly. Unless augmented by spells (widely known among illithids). And yes, that is a business opportunity that might be more popular if not for the "we're superior to lesser beings" illithid mindset.

I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around this, but that may be the point. What is the catalyst for the unpredictability of arcane spellcasting? Improper components, faith in the spell / weave, or is it truly arbitrary? 
+_> [@] Spellcasting always has some unpredictability, most commonly due to Weave surges/ripples (you're trying to swim out to sea from a beach, and a monster wave comes in), or the presence of previous magic (you might be unaware of) in a locale, that your magic reacts with.

However, due to how closely that sounds to another not-so-kind word
Do you propose any alternatives? 
+_> [@] Sure. He is also known as the Doombringer, and in parts of the Realms is worshipped as Assuran. And "Hoar" is a corruption of "Halor" (pronounced like the name "Hal" plus "oar," with the stress on the "Hal;" his priests still use this full name in secret prayers).

Song dragons do have a human form; they stay in whatever form they were slain in.

+_> 1)
Your impression is correct when it comes a god's power; a deity is greater, lesser, or otherwise in direct relationship to the strength and quality of their worship.
Their influence among mortals and their fellow deities, however, is partly related to their 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) power, but is determined more by how they wield that power: their deeds and actions.
If a mortal comes to mistrust a deity, and worships them out of fear or to keep their displeasure at bay, that worship is of 'lower quality' than eager 'love and trust' worship.

By chance are there any plans for another Elminster book? Or a book based in the realms?

?_> [@] 
I have a question regarding magic items and reuse. My particular question pertains to 3.xE but it may be more general.
Several listed magic items have a reuse time of once a week, but Faerun uses a 10-day division. How does this effect these magic items, or does it? 
+_> [@] Folk in Faerûn use tendays, and don't know what a "week" means. But the game designers writing game rulebooks are writing them for us real-world readers, who do. So by a week they DO mean 7 days (7 full days, or 168 hours) between uses. (Try early = nothing happens.)

Sun Mar 09 01:39:44 (Cormyr, Harper, Realmslore, Thorass)

?_> Time for a bit of #SilverUnicorns #DnD!
I had a migraine last week so I’m fuzzy on the details of what’s going on, but I’ve got the important shapes of the whole thing. Harper friend’s daughter kidnapped by pirates called Darks (no relation to the DC villain) and /1 
?_> There’s slavers . . this is potentially unrelated to the kidnapping. I killed a slaving crate with the help of #RingOfWinter and . . we’re in a tunnel chasing some bad lady what owns a Fest hall in . . Elventree? 
Okay that looks right. Retrograde amnesia overcome . . i think. 
?_> Oh . . a portal. Our day continues as we watch our quarry walk into a portal. Or is it called a gate? Portal I think. i’d ask Ed but I don’t care about the semantics that much.
But . . yay . . magical travel. 
?_> Oh. A stone giant.
This may prove interesting. 
?_> He doesn’t speak Common. Lovely. Apparently, in fact, Common offends him. He’s quite grouchy now. [:] 
?_> Well . . nor Sylavan, Elven, nor Thorass.
Bloody giant 
?_> Fyn casts Comprehend Languages!
Okay first . . this bloke ain’t the sharpest cookie on the tree. Second . . he reckons only that Bad Lady is allowed through the portal. [:] 
?_> Not much n of a conversationalist either 
?_> Oh right.
Fyn: “i can understand HIM, it doesn’t let him understand US”
Shayna: “🤦‍♀️ . . what a perfectly useless spell!!”
And now she’s trying to get close enough to cat Tongues on him 
?_> I made him a giant puppy
He’s not so bad really. 
?_> Oh joy. The portal lets out into a basement. 
?_> A basement where someone’s been storing their drunk guards 
?_> I have just used the flimsiest of logic to absolutely flummox the guards.
This is amusing 
?_> Darn. After Mr Your Doom falls on his arse the group’s spokesdrunk decides that they should all dona drunken charge.
This would be hilarious but someone’s going to get rather injured running about a slippy damp basement with impared coordination holding deadly weapons 
?_> Shayna is scolding them like a nanny or schoolteacher.
Because Shayna 
?_> Now she’s got him by by the ear 👂 and it’s scolding him [:] 
?_> The guards’ weapons are now encased in ice
She’s told the guards still conscious that they shouldn’t have weapons while drunk . . especially sonce the floor is a sheet of ice. 
?_> Longer than intended seriousness intermission complete. Stupid asthma.
Now back to our game. We’re in an Elvenholt Thingy . . there’s so many portals . . one-way, naturally 
?_> Oh we’re in another freaking basement.
What’s up with the basements?! I should consider actually tagging Alex and Ed to ask . . . . . . nah
Moving on 
?_> And before anyonr asks, live-tweeting a #DnD game works because [@] writes slowish and doesn’t know short hand. So it’s actually helpful so I don’t get bored and distracted.
I stay focused while she makes notes or loses her pencil again or has to look things up 
?_> There’s a very disconcerting chest in this basement.
Full of wet rocks?!
WTF?!? 
?_> Buckets of wet rotting leaves 🍁?!?
Did i just find a WEIRD version of Hawkeye Pierce’s gin still??? 
?_> Are these baby shambling mounds?
Taking ZERO chances. 
?_> It’s a bloody refrigerator.
We have Shayna.
Seriously this is her intended fare for that thing anyway is to install it in the c temple wine cellar 
?_> Scratch that. We don’t need food, it’s probably what feeds those guards in the other room.
We’ll pack it all back up and move along. 
?_> I AM now slightly irked with [@] & [@] . . seriously guys?! “Mind your fingers”?!?
That’s a sick joke. Funny, clever, exactly something I might do . . but sick.
I’m somewhat curious just why, in setting, someone wrote that on a chest of food . . but . . oy vey 
?_> A new basement.
And . . a sentence that is actually causing me pain.
Is . . there’s punctuation missing or SOMETHING. That doesn’t parse clearly. [:] 
?_> I’ve just been informed the room is devoid of lice.
I’m quite glad of this but was unaware this should have been a concern in previous rooms 
?_> It’s devoid of LIFE . . except a mouse which it’s probably devoid of soon since we’re travelling woth both a goshawk & owl 
?_> Next room.
Sigh . . if it’s another basement we’re going to need a TARDIS to explain to the elven architect about certain aspects of aesthetic design or something. 
?_> Oh COME ON!!!
I grok these are underground so that the entrance to the hold is properly secured or whatever but JFC! Could there be a wall with a “bugger this for a lark I’m going home” portal?! 
?_> Oh . . an armoury. Fascinating. 
?_> Well THAT was interesting [spoiler]
New room. 
?_> Now we’ve got the Tin Man’s dyke sister, Wooden Butch.
This woman edits my stories, y’all . . I may have to reconsider that arrangement 
?_> ALE ROOM!!! 
?_> Oh . . WINE CELLAR!! 
?_> Winter Wine leaves something to be desired to fhe refined palate ofnan elf, a half elf, and a noble.
Bet you a lion Mels likes it though 
?_> Well . . the Drinking Water is just what it sounds like. Not a clever name for a wine. [:] 
?_> Elven mint wine time
This . . is is worthwhile. 
?_> Oh! There’s is ale!
Oh . . nothing impressive.
Pity.
Moving on [:] 
?_> Well . . this is . . perplexing.
How doesnone LEAVE this room 🤨 [:] 
?_> . . that’s interesting but not the exit.
At least we won’t die of thirst? 
?_> Wizards are WEIRD!!!
WTAF?!?
Exit still not located 
?_> Fyn: “. . though most mages don’t concern themselves with safety maybe as much as they should
Shayna: *a very No Shit Sherlock scoff* [:] 
?_> Oh . . i SEE . . more slaver gear about to be freeze dried and shattered 
?_> Lliiran prayers are being invoked as this transpires to say the least 
?_> This begs an interesting question, please, [@] 
Is there any greater affront to a Joydancer & Lliira than slavery? I’m trying to imagine one & can’t. Hospitality, joy, liberty . . am I thinking right that these rumours/signs of slavers would have Shayna *UTTERLY* outraged? 
+_> [@] You have the right of it. Slavery is detested by most Cormyreans, and hated by Lliira and her joydancers.

Thu May 29 17:20:36 (Realmslore, Spellplague, Toril, the Weave)

+_> Human person [@] in 4th, who discovered the new way to manipulate magic? Did the Arcane users realise you could still pour an encounter’s worth of power into an effective yet weaker version of the Vancian magic, or did the Gods have to tell them? 
+_> 1)
So here we are at the last of that batch of your questions (not last posed, but last for me to get to answering).
Arcane magic, aside from the direct guidance of tutors and the indirect guidance of watching others successfully 
+_> 2) cast spells, and following the spellbooks and scrolls written by dead and gone predecessor wielders of the Art, has always been a matter of experimentation.
Working from the ‘bones’ (structure, relevant verbal, somatic, and 
+_> 3) material components) of what has gone before, a spellcaster experiments to try to cause a different effect. Even many wizards who never deliberately experiment, or set out to create a spell, do so when they substitute, like a 
+_> 4) cook in a kitchen who lacks basil but tries to make do with oregano, one material component for another.
So what happened after the Spellplague hit was that arcane spellcasters discovered their magic didn’t work, or did things 
+_> 5) they didn’t anticipate it doing (so when they cast a Fireball, what happened was instead a random Wand of Wonder effect). Moreover, other mortals, now terrified at what these out-of-control arcane spellcasters might do, or 
+_> 6) wanting to settle earlier scores, slew or maimed a lot of wizards. If an arcane spellcaster survived this tumult, they may well hide their Gift to wield magic, and just not try to work any magic at all, forever or for a long 
+_> 7) time.
Eventually, in private, they might dare to try casting something—and discover that the casting worked. If they did it again and got a reliable result, they’d discovered on their own that magic worked again.
That’s who 
+_> 8) discovered magic “had returned” or, when it was still unstable, new ways to cast that were more or less reliable for them. So there was no grand discoverer whose name should be written into the history books, there were 
+_> 9) many wielders of the Art all over Toril discovering what worked and didn’t work, and daring to use magic again.
The Gods were in the same boat: when the Spellplague hit, as I described in my previous reply, the Weave 
+_> 10) suddenly didn’t work as they were used to it working. Some of them kept trying, until eventually the Weave started working again (poorly). So the gods couldn’t tell mortal arcane spellcasters what to do, because they didn’t 
+_> 11) know what to tell them. The deities of Toril aren’t infallible and all-knowing; far from it. Many of them aren’t even expert on their own portfolios. Having a lot of brute-force power contributes to that; most of the time 
+_> 12) they don’t need to be experts, they can batter down and overwhelm problems and situations, rather than deftly dealing with them.

Thu May 29 17:06:06 (Realmslore, Shadowdale, Spellplague, Toril, the Weave)

+_> Human person [@] 4th edition, when the Spellplague hit, the Weave couldn’t be manipulated due to the inherent madness of the Far Realm infecting it. Was that the reason Gods couldn’t provide the same function of spells as before? 
+_> 1)
The Spellplague is what mortals on Toril called the Weave going wild, so wild surges happened, arcane spellcasters went mad or their brains literally exploded or caught fire, existing magics and newly-cast spells usually 
+_> 2) failed or twisted into unforeseen and unintended effects, and so on.
The Weave went wild because Mystra is the Weave, and had just been murdered; the Weave was in turmoil, with its own energies and the world-energies it 
+_> 3) accesses rippling and roiling through it in clashing tidal waves.
The only reason the Weave didn’t collapse is because Mystra had foreseen the consequences of her death, and guarded against them, adding to those mortals 
+_> 4) (the Chosen, in particular) who held a fraction of her divinity (divine silver fire) additional mortals, witting and unwitting, to be more Weave anchors. So the Weave was ‘anchored’ by many mortals, widely scattered across 
+_> 5)
Toril, who were all tiny parts of Mystra. From them her vestige (seen briefly onstage in a cave in one of my Sage of Shadowdale novels) could arise to observe what was going on and give guidance to mortals who would heed her 
+_> 6) (her Chosen), and eventually she could return, and by means of these same Weave anchors the Weave could survive, so arcane magic could go on working, with increasing certainty/trustworthiness as time passed, and the Weave 
+_> 7) stabilized.
Immediately after the Spellplague hit, the Gods couldn’t answer any prayers with spells, because they were used to calling directly on the Weave to do so, and the Weave wouldn’t work. So mortal clerics could 
+_> 8) renew only 1st through 3rd level spells, just as they can when on another plane where they are out of touch with their deity. (Instead of having to go across the world to speak to someone in person, the gods had become used 
+_> 9) to picking up the telephone to talk—and when they tried to use the phone/the Weave immediately after the Spellplague hit, it was alive-crackling but not working.)
As the Weave slowly stabilized, gods found it glitch-prone 
+_> 10) sometimes it reliably communicated spells to those praying to them, and sometimes it didn’t. So what they could use it for had changed, and not for the better. Until Mystra returned.

Thu May 29 16:20:06 (Realmslore, Toril, the Realms)

+_> Human person [@] do Gods sustain themselves through belief? Is there an independent power they can draw on, apportioned to them by Ao’s rule based on the number of followers they have? Or is belief itself the energy, a form of psychic emanation that the Gods feed on  
+_> (for want of a better term). If so, how does it bridge such large gaps? 
+_> 1)
Worship (NOT belief; in the Realms, all sane sentient beings “believe in” ALL of the deities) is a catalyst enabling deities to access more (or less) of the natural energies of a world/plane that I referred to in an earlier 
+_> 2) reply (wind, tides and currents, sunlight, heat, and so on).
Ao has nothing directly to do with this, and it’s not based on numbers of followers, but on amount and quality (fervence of devotion) of actual worship: prayers 
+_> 3) deeds dedicated to the god/done while calling on the god (“Odin, guide my arm!”), offerings, etc. Deities can call on the energies of the plane where they make their home (the part of it they rule and have reshaped to their 
+_> 4) their preferences) and the energies of Toril, where they are venerated: when they manifest (send visions or voices or even avatars), it’s a two-way street: these ‘sendings’ are also sponges absorbing the energy of worship and 
+_> 5) transmitting back to the deity. Again, it’s a catalyst allowing them to access more world-energies. They CAN feed on it directly, but in doing so they consume it so it isn’t still extant to be a catalyst, so they can’t use 
+_> 6) it as such to absorb more world-energies.

+_> 1)
Not a lot, but like pennies, or drops of water, they add up. Drops of pure water are actually a better analogy: we humans need to ingest water, sooner or later, or we die. A deity needs worship, to retain godhood (not

So one act of worship is like a speck, but mountain ranges are made of many specks. “A wise god spurns no worship,” as the old

Human person [@] a God give a cleric, say, Magic Missile? What in-game reason is there for not granting it? Mystra?

Yes, Mystra is the in-game reason for denying a deity the use of any particular magic, consistently or temporarily. And she can and has ‘cut off’ deities from certain spells, and even the entire Weave (herself), denying 
+_> 2) them magic completely (though Ao put a stop to that, and swiftly). She WILL prevent a deity from overusing or misusing this power (for example, Diety X wants to grant all of his novices the power to Disintegrate anyone who 
+_> 3) stands in their way: hard NO).
But on a one-off basis, deities quite often bestow upon mortals spells they normally wouldn’t be able to wield, due to class or level, or to aid them even when they didn’t request it, if the god 
+_> 4) wants to, or to give them what they need, not what they THINK they need.
More often, however, it works in the other direction: a mortal has been “bad” (displeased the god), so the deity doesn’t grant the spell that is prayed

+_> Trey [@] 5e Sword coast map has some wide lands in the north and east; do you have current or past lore on such places as the Frozen Forest, Turnback Mountains, or the lands about these? [May 21]
Long Reply Thread 2: 
+_> 1)
The frigid tundra between them and the Frozen Forest was once extensively patrolled by ice archons, now (in 5e) more commonly known as “ice elemental myrmidons,” and a few still roam the area, attacking all intruders. 
+_> 2)
A greater peril on these plains are marauding remorhaz, who come south out of the Great Glacier to wander and devour. They concentrate most on attacking gnoll caravans (ore-laden sledges coming along the Remorhaz Ride caravan 
+_> 3) trail from Mount Ghaethluntar, a huge mountain honeycombed with caverns linked by natural and carved-out tunnels, and inhabited by thousands of flind and gnolls).
The Alaphaer Run is a fast-flowing, icy river of drinkable 
+_> 4) water that’s normally iced over (it runs under a roof of ice thick enough to support a heavily-laden sledge, or even a landing dragon). The river is blessed by the goddess Auril (“Alaphaer” is one of her older names), and 
+_> 5) runs through the Planes of Existence as it descends from the mammothbacks, flowing into and out of Auril’s Deep Wilds home realm several times as it heads for the Frozen Forest.
The Frozen Forest itself gets its name from the 
+_> 6) glittering ice that sheaths the needles and boughs of its close-standing conifers (at the forest’s edge, most are bent over under the weight of the ice; in the forest depths, the trees stand too close to bend, and are in fact 
+_> 7) often welded together by ice, high up, and can’t bend much). Almost entirely evergreens (the few hardwoods tend to be long-dead, bare trunks), the Frozen Forest is vast and has very few clearings (the Monument of the 
+_> 8)
Ancients occupies one) and animal tracks, and no human-cut roads or trails.
The Forest is wreathed in everpresent, drifting ground fogs, which persist for the same reason the trees of the forest don’t shatter and die of the 
+_> 9) cold, and their roots can drink flowing water: warm magma flows near the surface of the earth, beneath the forest (the presence of these flows, and the running-water and forging opportunities their warmth provides, are the 
+_> 10) reason why such subterranean cities as Forlarn of the gnomes, and Glanderultok, can exist in the region).
Caribou winter over in the Frozen Forest, lynx (and even a few giant lynx) dwell in it, preying on the abundant hares 
+_> 11) tree-cats” (squirrels), voles, foxes, and grouse. Owls and a handful of giant owls also make this forest their home, as do fey who do not love sentient intruders of any sort. Moose, elk, and rothé forage endlessly along its 
+_> 12) verges, moving constantly to where they can find and eat new growing shoots, and moving to the lee of the forest when the worst storms hit.
At various warmer times in the past, humans have tried to settle in the Frozen 
+_> 13)
Forest, and found the tumbled ruins and foundations of even more ancient settlements, in which enchanted weapons (including a crossbow of speed known as “The Army Scythe,” encountered in the Baldur’s Gate computer game) were 
+_> 14) found. Persistent hobgoblin attacks decimated these settlers, until the few survivors fled south to the cities of the Moonsea shore. Not all of these ruins (from early Netheril?) have been thoroughly explored, for even 
+_> 15) then, fell monsters lurked in their deepest underground passages and cellars. SOMETHING, Elminster warns, has prevented dwarves and gnomes from establishing permanent settlements or forges under the Frozen Forest. 
+_> 16)
And there you have it. [Long Reply Thread 2 ends.] Hope this is of help!

+_> 2) in an upclass hall the name escapes me) with a cleverly designed fan? 
+_> 3)
Eddie doth reply:
In Waterdeep, wealthy folk and nobles can hire many traveling tutors (that is, they make appointments for training sessions of about two hours in length at certain times a tenday, and so go from pupil to pupil 
+_> 4) in the city) to teach all manner of self-defense, from “dirty alley tricks” like kneeing and eye-gouging and throat-punching to elegant dancing that happens to include hold-breaks and disarms and takedowns. And yes, using a 
+_> 5) fan like a baton to break fingers or numb nerves (the old “bash the funnybone,” but also the hits that make a tight grip spasm open). Most of these tutors are aging but still supple human or half-elven men or women of social 
+_> 6) elegance and manners, who charge two to five gold per training session, and also hire themselves out as ‘arm candy’ light bodyguards from time to time, attending feasts and revels and so picking up a free meal in the process. 
+_> 7)
If you’re in the mid-1300s DR, some names of such tutors include the human males Rondarl Stormfeather (white-haired, slender to bony, impeccably dressed and with ‘perfect’ manners) and Morlyn Dyre (yes, related to the Dyre 
+_> 8) family who appeared in Elaine and my Waterdeep novel; darkly handsome, a master actor in perfect control of face and voice; accomplished at mimicry, and dancing), the human females Janessra Haeleeyaro (who can act the part of 
+_> 9) the ‘perfect noblewoman’ and looks matronly rather than beautiful; she hails from Telflamm, and is an expert at picking locks and sewing intricate clothes, often lightning-repairing garments torn by her pupils in their 
+_> 10) exertions) and Vaelarra Hamartranth (from Tethyr, an acrobat who once made a living as a ‘human statue,’ posing immobile at feasts and revels in strange costumes or vivid body-paint; she has an impish sense of humor, and is 
+_> 11) expert at hurling and catching small objects), and the half-elf androgyne (true hermaphrodite, usually prefers to dress and act female, but will readily switch if hired to do so; a not-so-former actor and prostitute) 
+_> 12)
Phandarla/Phandarl Immerstorn.
The most famous such tutor of Waterdeep was Elender Tanturho, who died of heartstop in 1242 DR; it’s still city slang to ask “Got yourself a tanturho, have you?” or ask, “Tanturhoing?”

Sure. They’re all North Ward-resident families who have made their fortunes by “mixed mercantile means.” That is, they invest in some shops, rent out North Ward and Castle Ward buildings they own to other businesses (for 
+_> 2) shops and offices, not “workshops”/factories, and not residential) to make coin, invest in ship cargoes, and run their own businesses.
I’ll tackle just the Eskults, this time.

The Eskults make bulk glue from dead horses, run a successful locksmithing service, buy local farm crops for bulk shipping to the Ten Towns, Mintarn, and other “hungry-mouth” areas, and breed fine riding horses.

The Eskults live in three adjacent, knocked-together tallhouses on northfront Saerdoun Street, in the block between Whaelgond Way and Pony Way, and are led by Jaruldimond Eskult and his wife Laedra, who have three young

There are also two old, dotty 
+_> 7) stay-at-home maiden aunts, Barathta and Joysa (who prefer to live in an older era), and a fat, jovial old rake of an uncle, Hammrar, who knows where all the family skeletons are hidden (and their closets, too), and who really

+_> PastorGall [@] just a random question, maybe you cant comment but would you know the weight of dragon bones at various size categories? There is no reference online anywhere for apecifica like that. If NDA stops you, thats fine too. :I

Well, dragons do vary from individual to individual, but here are some general guidelines, attested to by Faerûnian wizards and sages who specialize in such things.
So a Wyrmling (Medium) dragon averages 3 tons live weight 
+_> 2) a Young (Large) dragon averages 4.5 tons, an Adult (Huge) dragon averages 6.6 tons, and an Ancient (Gargantuan) dragon averages 8.8 tons. The bones of a dragon average only ten percent of its total body weight (some 
+_> 3) dragon bones are hollow, reducing its weight so it can fly more easily), so if you clean and gather an entire skeleton, the total weight will be these living weights divided by ten.

+_> [@] "Drow" to rhyme with "cow," NOT "Drow" to rhyme with "row" (as in rowing a boat, or aligning things along a line). This is according to Gary Gygax, in many, MANY GenCon speeches and seminars, not me 
+_> [@] And being as Gary put the drow into the game (no, he didn't invent them, but he invented the version of them seen in D&D), I bow to his preferences.
In the Realms, with regional accents, you'll hear both pronunciations

+_> [@] As the Steel dragon is a Nigel Findley rewrite combining my original steel FR dragons with other steel dragons created (all independently) by other D&D designers, I think it's pretty good. ;} I also created deep dragons, electrum dragons, were/song dragons, dracoliches, and more.
