?_> ‘Nother Thay question for you, [@] are there any mercenary companies in the Unapproachable East that Szass Tam could hire to help stage the invasion of a neighboring state? (Aglarond for example. .) 
+_> 1)
Yes, but not big “army”-sized ones. The dragon princes of Murghôm permit small (40 veteran and fully-equipped, full-pay members or less) mercenary companies (founded by former Murghômi army commanders as that kingdom’s former army shrank under pressure from, and 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) the decrees of, the dragon princes) to exist, so long as they don’t band together for any purpose whatsoever within the land, or in any adjacent land (for example, Thay). The reason for this is that the ruling dragons don’t want a large army or armies to

If Tam used magic or blackmail to coerce any Murghômi mercenaries to work for him, under any circumstances, the dragon princes would lash out at him, by slaying and destroying the bodies of  
+_> 5) double the number of competent senior Red Wizards (versus number of mercenaries). They’ve done it before, and they’ll do it again if need be, and Szass Tam will seek to avoid this, because he hates being publicly bested by anyone and have Thay’s populace know  
+_> 6) it (this is one reason he’s been reluctant, and therefore slow, to invade Aglarond one more time; too many public past failures).
And the Mulhorandi watch Thay for signs of weakness, too, and if the dragon princes are humbling Tam right next door, they’ll  
+_> 7) send raiding parties. (Divine rulers and their avatars and Chosen have no fear of Tam, and precious little respect.)
All of which means Szass Tam will likely try to avoid a war on many fronts by hiring one Murghômi mercenary band at a time, as fast-moving

Nimjammir, Vurlakh, and Sessim all host resident mercenary bands. Naelor’s Banner (based on Thuldan Way on the western edge of Nimjammir)

Shaele Flamehair is perhaps the most notorious mercenary commander, for her calmly reckless boldness as well as her fire-orange hair and beauty, and Shaele’s Shields out of Vurlakh are among the most expensive of the busy mercenary bands as a

Mon Feb 14 22:41:16 (Field Ward, Realmslore, Skullport, Waterdeep, Waterdhavian, the Deep, the Realms)

?_> Greetings master [@] , I'm doing some research and found some discrepancies in the population amount of Waterdeep these days. Can you talk a little bit about that? I would like to compare the city of Waterdeep numbers with real cities =) 
+_> 1)
So “these days” in the Realms is the 1490s DR, which means the “summer high” population of Waterdeep is pushing two million.
There has always been a seasonal swing in the city’s population totals: folk with means and lifestyle to do so often relocate south for 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) the winter months (so population totals dip), and “everybody” traveling for trade flocks to this crossroads city in the warmer months, creating the summer high.
Waterdeep has grown in both population (density) and surface area covered, over the time of the  
+_> 3) published Realms (mid-1300s DR to almost 1500 DR). For example, densely-populated Field Ward was unpopulated in the 1300s DR. Most Waterdhavians live in rented rooms above shops, so density is high, and buildings that were three to four storeys high in the  
+_> 4) s are being rebuilt taller and taller in the later half of the 1400s DR.
In the mid-1300s DR-era FORGOTTEN REALMS CAMPAIGN SETTING (the 3rd Edition D&D hardcover) the registered taxpaying population inside the city walls was 132,661, but Waterdeep had an  
+_> 5) official” population of 1,347,800, as the tax rolls included the Deep-ruled farmlands around the city (up to 40 miles out). (It doesn’t include Skullport, nor the Rat Hills.) The current summer high count includes the ruled environs. Note that a “registered  
+_> 6) taxpaying population” of 132,661 likely meant a real population of around 200,000, once homeless people, servants and ailing relatives that “live in” but were left off the tax rolls deliberately by ratepayers, and the city’s military are added in.

Sat Jan 15 18:50:36 (Realmslore, Sembia, Suzail)

?_> 1/2
Hello [@] from rainy California!
Suppose you are a forester who stumbles into a fight over territory between two bears in the King's Forest, and Queen Raedra sits the throne
You get away minus a boot and a claw-gash to your cloak that's sunk as far as your back. 
+_> 1)
Hultail boasts a cobbler who does repair work; a used clothing, belts, baldrics, and footwear shop; and a bootmaker.
The cobbler is Arlburt Nammond, of Bell Lane (winds generally N-S in southwestern built-up Hultail), a big-nose, fat, dumpy little bowlegged man 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) who’s amiable and always working (“he stitches in his sleep”). He does unlovely but very sturdy work, and folk come to him from all around.
The shop where you might be able to snag replacement used boots (with the usual “these feel odd on my feet” travails) 
+_> 3) is Muranee’s Old Treasures on the S side of Hultails’s main E-W street, run by Muranee Crownlinden and her “daughters” (six younger women unrelated to her, orphans and strays she’s taken in, who now help her run her shop, do the laundry and cooking and help  
+_> 4) with the buying; the most competent of them is probably Jeveldra Shieldwinter, from Suzail). The shop is a converted house, room after room full of sorted used goods on tables; don’t forget to check upstairs. Only the kitchen, the pantry attached to it, and  
+_> 5) the “back room” (laundry and back entrance) beyond that are off limits to patrons. Muranee and her daughters sleep on beds winched down from the attic through the upper-room ceilings once the shop is closed, every evening. They make up a merry household. 
+_> 6)
The bootmaker is Vhaerikho Lhlandast (“VARE-ik-ho Lul-AND-ast”) from Saerloon, a dapper halfling who’s a deadly-accurate mimic and works with a crew of gnomes (they all fled Sembia together after some scandal or trouble they don’t discuss). They do top-quality  
+_> 7) work worthy of expensive shops in the best cities, and if you have a tenday to spare, could make a single boot and weather it so it would look like part of a pair with a client’s surviving boot. 
+_> 8)
For a healer who can keep her mouth shut, you can’t do better than “Mother” Thaere (pronounced “Thair” to rhyme with hair), who lives in her garden-surrounded cottage east of Hultail proper, near the Thunderflow south riverbank (Thaere Mrindormra, local human  
+_> 9) family with a little half-elven blood three generations back; she’s the last to live locally, and is sixty-ish and unwed), but you could also seek out Sulimra “the Dark Rose,” a young, beautiful, andrecently-arrived woman from Turmish, who has dusky skin 
+_> 10) very black eyebrows, and some of the largest brown eyes ever seen in the face of a human of average size, and makes her living growing herbs, mixing medicines, and painting flattering portraits; she rents two back rooms in the cottage of the Widow Trawny 
+_> 11) on the southern edge of Hultail.
As for a fast mender of cloaks, tents, and robes (she doesn’t touch socks or “fancy dresses,” and her work is more sturdy than beautiful; it won’t stand out as crude, but she’ll pucker fabric edges together to get a stronger  
+_> 12) mend-seam rather than try for something subtle that won’t last/hold as well), I recommend Avarelle Myntdown, on Easting Lane (runs SW-NE at the southeastern edge of “built-up” Hultail, across from Harrafe Orlimbur’s red-roofed barn with the spire), a  
+_> 13) middle-aged, gentle woman who was once strikingly beautiful and now looks more “worn-out motherly” despite being unwed and never a mother. She will do work while you wait, and charges little; many pay her her in food (and generously, as she’s locally well-liked).

+_> 1)
Rashemi witch-masks” (more properly: “face-veils of the Wychlaran Rashemaar”) do vary, but most half-masks are very old (or rather, worn by very old witches). The vast majority are “more than full face” masks: they cover the

+_> 2) sides of the head (with biteouts in their edges so they can be put into place without fouling the wearer’s ears), are cloth-lined on the inside but a light rigid shell (like baked-hard, lacquered paper mâché, though they’re

+_> 4) pinned there, then pull the pins [which ride in boot sheaths, and are often coated with sleep-poison] and adjust the hair down to cover the headband).
The front or public surface of the mask may be of any hue (and some witches 
+_> 5) own and use a “fashion array” of different-coloured masks), has two eye-slits but no nasal slits (the mask “bumps out” along a center line down to the chin to provide not just room for the nose, but ample space for breathing

Wychlaran, and a semi-circular “upper half of a human eye” drawing, like a protractor but with a long-axis-vertical-diamond eyeball at the bottom center, is a mark of advanced seniority among the Wychlaran).
Most masks are of

?_> [@] I got a question. Are there any cities close or similar to Mordulkin that aren't ruins? I'm mostly leaning towards Cimbar
Context in Twitlonger [:] 
+_> 1)
Mordulkin is in ruins by 1479 DR, though folk DO live there (harassed by adventuring bands who come looking for forgotten, buried-in-cellars treasure to loot).
Its nearest neighbour (and rival) is Luthcheq, spires JUST visible on clear days on the horizon 
+_> 2) around the curve of the Bay of Chessenta from Mordulkin. Being as one of the PCs wields arcane magic, and nages are persecuted in Luthcheq, it’s likely that the PCs would have to flee that city, and might very well go to the ruins of Mordulkin to dwell, as a

Many of whom will proudly tell strangers that they hail from Mordulkin.

?_> [@] Hi Ed, I hope all is well! I have a question about healing potions in the Realms. What are the main ingredients? Where are they produced? If one wanted to cut the supply lines of it (and disrupt the creation of new healing potions), where would it happen? Thanks! 
+_> 1)
If you wanted to cut the supply line of healing potions in the Realms, you’d have to destroy almost every temple in the world, and thousands of “hedge wizards” and “local wise women,” too; they all produce healing potions. There’s no one central source to target. 
+_> 2)
There are many different “recipes” for making and enchanting healing potions, but they can’t include alcohol or any acid or solvent, and they all include protein. (I’ve detailed a few of these recipes, down the years.) 
+_> 3)
One common healing potion recipe contains blood from a regenerating creature, balanced with dew droplets gathered from moonfern leaves, to prevent the potion imbiber from acquiring any traits, body features, or tendencies of that regenerating creature, and added  
+_> 4) to a base of spring water that’s risen out of limestone. When these are thoroughly mixed and chilled (NOT heated), add just one drop of waterglass, as a binder.
BTW, folks: Twitter is getting so rocky that I’m taking my long lore answers to my (free) Discord

Mon Feb 14 19:59:29 (Realmslore, the Realms)

?_> [@] Good evening! There’s been debate among my fanbase regarding Dragons in Faerûn after my character gave birth to Half-Dragon children so I wanted to ask: Are Dragons classified as reptiles by scholars in the Realms or do they have their own classification eg. Draconic? 
?_> [@] [@] Thankfully we have a handy dandy chart for this. Dragons are straight Ys down the board, while Kobolds and Lizardfolk are significantly more restricted in terms of cross-species compatibility. Thus we can assume that Dragons are significantly different from reptiles on that basis [:] 
+_> [@] [@] Thank you!
Yes, sages and scholars in the Realms who know what they're speaking or writing about classify dragons ("draco") as distinct from reptiles but somehow related (they share sufficient characteristics to suggest a distant ancestry no one alive today knows).

Thu Feb 24 18:13:18 (Calimshan, Elturel, Realmslore, Scornubel)

?_> [@] Ed, can you share anything more about askata, Elturian grey or Green Calishite? 
+_> 1)
Lore appearances:
Elturian Grey and Green Calishite appear in Aurora’s Whole Realms Catalogue. I referred to askata in my Elminster Speaks web column at the Wizards of the Coast website.
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2)
Askata is made in Impiltur, from a blend of goat and cow milk to which a particular moss is added (and later, of course, strained out). The result is a yellow, easily-crumbled cheese rather like real-world old cheddar in taste, that melts readily and that tastes  
+_> 3) more and more like roast almonds the older it gets. Some nobles jig askata in wines, to derive what they call a “wonderful” culinary treat, but some of their halfling servants and cooks describe as “vomitous 
+_> 4)
Elturian Grey (also known as “dwarfcheese” and “stonework”) originated in Elturel but these days is made in many places between Amn and Scornubel. It requires a particular mold that grows on grass and clover, takes months to mature but also keeps in open air for  
+_> 5) almost a year, and looks like real-world blue cheese or Stilton, but has marbling of black, not green or blue. The stonework nickname comes from its looks, and it’s sometimes called "dwarfcheese” because almost all dwarves love it, hoard it, and rhapsodize  
+_> 6) over its taste. Elturian Grey has a very strong taste and smell, the latter almost like vinegar and the former like ham and pineapple fried together with hot sauce.
Green Calishite is made all over Calimshan, and is the longest-lasting, least-crumbly of the  
+_> 7) many curry-infused Calishite cheeses. The curry gives the pale beige cheese (which tastes like real-world Colby, and which Calishites call “rumnund” and eat ‘as is’ only as a sauce thickener) an aquamarine hue and an intriguing or “rich,” hot spicyness 
+_> 8) best drunk with wine, cordials, or spirits. 
+_> Sorry, typo above: "jig askata in wines" should be JUG askata in wines.

Tue Jan 25 16:28:07 (Realmslore, Silverymoon, Sundabar)

+_> Craig Vincent [@] Ed! Regional maps show the road from Silverymoon to Everlund on the east bank, however city maps of Silverymoon seem to say the trail leaves the southern part of the city on the other side of the river. What route does the trail take? 
+_> 1)
The caravan road linking Everlund and Silverymoon departs northbank Silverymoon (the older part of that city) through the Sundabar Gate, on the same side of the river as northbank Everlund (passing through Everlund’s Silverymoon Gate). 
+_> 2)
There is also a trail linking southbank Silverymoon with southbank Everlund (via Everlund’s Downriver Gate), that winds through the Silverwood and is used by locals who know that forest, and by woodcutters, not wagon-merchants (except in emergencies). 
+_> 3)
About a half-day upriver of Silverymoon, there is a ferry crossing the Rauvin (four-wagon-sized flat barge, linked to stout cross-cables both sides that never survive the spring torrents, and drawn by winched-cables with the aid of rothé teams walking cleared  
+_> 4) runs” out into the forest, both sides of the river (both banks have fortified pens for the rothé, mules, oxen, and messenger-horses). Most wagons and carts use this ferry to go to and from the northbank road, which is why the meandering trail into the depths  
+_> 5) of the Silverwood (where it branches many times; only humans on foot and with a mule or pony at most can win through to Olostin’s Hold) isn’t shown on large-area-coverage maps.

Not a "mad cackler" or megalomaniac. Just quietly erratic.

There's often a difference between in-Realms titles (which usually came first) and D&D game class and subclass titles.

Fri Apr 04 21:52:35 (Aglarond, Realmslore, Red Wizards, Szass Tam, Thay)

?_> Hey [@] is the fortress-city of Emmech under the control of Thay and now called Undumor? 
+_> 1)
Yes. Emmech fell in a big battle in 1432 DR, one of the few attacks by Red Wizards (plus bodyguards of living soldiers) that was swift and hit hard.
It came at the same time as the more usual “huge, plodding invading army of undead” advance through the  
+_> 2)
Shyvar Pass, a massive show of force that included teleported live, bewildered monsters to rampage before the invaders, and golems striding with the Thayan army. This invading force was destroyed before it won free of the Tannath Mountains, but it was just a  
+_> 3) feint, to distract the Aglarondan defenders so that when the small strike force that assaulted Emmech burst in, no Aglarondan reinforcements could be swiftly sent to foil them. These foremost Red Wizards managed to bring down the wards of the fortress 
+_> 4) allowing hundreds of less powerful Red Wizards to be teleported in, to hold the city.
Vicious street fighting went on for a month, during which many barges of undead soldiers, weapons, and other supplies came down the River Umber from Nethentir and Nethjet  
+_> 5) and poured into Emmech. In the end, the Thayans exterminated the citizenry and all Aglarondan relief forces, and held the city, though the Thayan cost was literally thousands of Red Wizards (“the greater part of the competent spellhurlers zulkirs commanded 
+_> 6) as Elminster put it), several thousand living Thayan soldiers, and tens of thousands of undead. This toll slowed Szass Tam’s ambitious plans for decades: he’d won Emmech but hollowed out his military strength in doing so. Had Aglarond known how weak Thay was  
+_> 7) left “at home,” and possessed the stomach for risking its own far-fewer spellcasters in hit-and-run raids all over Thay, they could have brought living Thay to lawlessness, a fallen realm unable to feed itself in the short term—but they did not.
The cost of  
+_> 8) taking Emmech convinced Szass Tam once and for all that undead legions were his best road ahead: they never tired and did not need to be fed or watered. For living Thayans, the lean years following the conquest of Emmech cost them their last vestiges of  
+_> 9) respect for Szass Tam—as opposed to fear.
Once Emmech was firmly in Thayan hands, Szass Tam installed a personally-loyal apprentice, Undumora (“OON-dew-MORE-ah”), whose magical mastery was lowly (4th level) but administrative skills great, to govern Emmech 
+_> 10)
She served capably, building the city into a formidable Thayan fortress from which undead armies could issue in strength at any time; Thay managed to hold it against Aglarondan counter-attacks precisely because it wasn’t functioning as a city for the living to  
+_> 11) dwell in, but only a fortress. Eventually (in the spring of 1466 DR) Undumora was destroyed—literally disintegrated—by simbarch spells (the Simbarch Council had formed the opinion that harassing attacks were the best way to “busy” the Thayans in Emmech, so  
+_> 12) whatever invasions they were planning against the rest of Aglarond would be hampered and delayed, and this was one such “harassment”), and Szass Tam, who was reportedly “wildly beyond rage” that he couldn’t recover enough of Undorma to bring her back as  
+_> 13) undead (many living Thayans are of the opinion that he wanted her as some sort of consort), renamed the city Undumor in her memory once he regained his calm.
Today, Undumor remains a fortress under Thayan command, and some Thayans call it “the Hollow City 
+_> 14) precisely because it only has a few living inhabitants (the foremost Red Wizards and their warrior bodyguards). It has no one governor (to serve as a target), but six Red Wizards can all make command decisions; the most senior, but also the most cautious, is  
+_> 15) a conjurer named Ruralekh Prator (“RURR-ah-lek PRAY-tor”), who can summon up to five fearsome monsters (incuding a behir, a chimera, and a roper) to fight for him if he feels the need.

+_> 1)
No. Destroying Undermountain won’t stop Halaster returning; he’s a Weave anchor and will return as a vestige no matter what happens to him, and Undermountain has so many other beings of power connected to it in various ways (including active, living dragons and

Eilistraee knows all the drow words for love, and the elvish ones, too.
The Drow words are: alurlssrin = unselfish, deep love raggath = act of love (lovemaking) lurraggath = act of love (sacrificial or noble deed)
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) ssinssrigg = passion, lust, greed, longing, love
And the Elvish words are: arkhlavae = lovemaking evae = love, absence of malice immaea = familial love, loyalty to kin and family

Incidentally, one nickname her six Sisters have for Eilstraee is "Darkfire-Of-Love"

Orcs have a world-view of ‘might makes right,’ and the weak can and should be weeded-out and exploited.
This doesn’t mean orcs can’t show mercy, kindness, or tenderness, and neither should they “burn it all down” without thought 
+_> 2) for prey regenerating (don’t eat the last horse, or even the last pair of horses, lest they be unable to breed and so be there to harvest next year). Orcs regard non-orcs as less in standing than orcs, and also have societies that value aggression and  
+_> 3) proving oneself as hardy,” which can lead orcs to attack creatures larger than themselves, or who far outnumber them. This racial character gets them labelled as “evil” by most humans. Most orcs don’t think about good or evil: there is the code of the tribe 
+_> 4) and there is empty chatter, and there are bellies to fill and battles to be won. (Many orcs will eat other orcs without hesitation or qualm.) So, yes, there is a fair amount of variation. As humans and many other foes can be food, orcs rarely leave wounded

Do you guys know if there has ever been a Forgotten Realm's source about Halfling's fertility / Unions between halfling's and other species? 
Stout hafling's mention potentially having dwarvish blood, but I am curious about any human & halfling unions. 
+_> 1)
Thanks to the Code of Conduct, you won't find much in print on cross-species fertility, beyond Gary Gygax's writings in DRAGON (when he was THE font of D&D). However, it's been said by TSR staffers at MANY GenCon panels that halflings are almost as fecund as

Rogue stones (which are so named, and defined, by their wild magic effect) can be all of those things: they can vary in size and overall outer hue (so, one can be blue and another ruby-red).
They are all translucent, and when 
+_> 2) sunlight falls upon them, are always chatoyant (= showing a band of bright reflected light, that’s caused by aligned “inclusions” within the stone) AND always iridescent, thanks to their translucence and one physical property

Why? They are liquid, or rather, they’re mineral dust suspended in

Thu Jan 13 18:29:00 (Ship-to-ship combat, Realmslore, Sembia, Spellplague, Tsurlagol)

?_> [@] Thank you! How about for more war-like maritime activities? 
+_> 1)
Sure!
So for warships, the fastest builders are:
Selvard Haeleophar, Master Shipbuilder, of Telflamm (a brilliant, mercurial dashing ladies-man whose feuds and tirades are legendary); he has built armor-plated coastal rakers with fitted rams, oars as well as 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) sails, and raised ballistae decks, in twelve days, but twenty-one days is the norm for his six drydock shipyard.
He has a rival, Vellard Sisters Shipwright of Tsurlagol, who can keel only three vessels at a time, but can turn out “bare-timbers but navigable 
+_> 3) rakers or battle-caravels in eighteen days (the norm? slips to nineteen or twenty days before crews can sail a new warship on its maiden shakedown voyage).
The cheapest good warship builders are:
Pelandro Rahavillar, Pelandro’s Peerless Shipyards, of Teziir 
+_> 4) maker of old-design “cruisers” (the large but unarmored and not ram-equipped battle caravels) that can double as merchant vessels when not fighting. Pelandro was a dashing ladies-man, but nowadays is a flamboyant old romantic with a cane and much wistful  
+_> 5) nostalgia. And six wives.
Jhassala Lyrimmjakh, of Nimpeth, specializes in small, fast coastal rakers, slender and stealthy and utterly unsuited to ramming or carrying heavy artillery of any sort. They have minimal comforts (decking turns the hold into one big  
+_> 6) common cabin), but are beautiful and very swift; lee-boards can be dropped on the “inside” of a turn to help them turn tight and quick. Most are painted in dark colors; they lie low in the water, and so are suited for stormy seas. Jhassala’s grandparents  
+_> 7) were slaves in Nimpeth, and she fiercely hunts and assassinates any slavers trying to revive the defunct slave-trade (it collapsed in the Spellplague and never recovered) in Nimpeth.
The sturdiest warships are built (slowly) by:
Ruelrond Honadarr, Master  
+_> 8)
Shipwright, of Hlath, famous among sailors as the builder of Honadarr’s Unsinkable Hulks,” wallowing wide-hulled, slow tubs that resist capsizing, are treated to be fire-resistant, and are nigh-impossible to sink (ramming them repeatedly or using storm waves  
+_> 9) to sail atop them and grapple to lodge atop, to shove them under ere cutting the grapple-lines seem to be the only ways to send one to the bottom). Critics sneer that they “sail sideways” and “have all the grace of a bloated dead ox carcass,” but they last 
+_> 10) and last, and last.
The most luxurious warships (“pamper-cabins” as well as fancy trim and brass railings and experimental ballistae and even mangonels mounted) are made (slowly and every expensively) by: Hargauntra Velrauthynd, Lady Master of the Waves 
+_> 11) of Saerloon, in Sembia. Her warships are large and beautiful, and much favoured by maritime powers for fleet flagships, to carry rulers or for celebratory sailpasts of cheering citizenry. (Realmslore, Sembia, Ship-to-ship combat, Spellplague, Tsurlagol)

Reading the excellent Sembia series right now, but one thing has me confused. In "The Burning Chalice" Presker Talendar takes point on the "False Perivel" plot. In "The Shattered Mask", Nuldrevyn is said to be the family's head. Then, in "Lord of Stormweather", (1/2)
Presker is said to be patriarch. Nuldrevyn is never mentioned again after "Mask". What happened to Nuldrevyn, and who was actually patriarch of the Talendars in the 1370s DR? (2/2)

+_> RPGMatch - connecting TTRPG players [@] there  [@] - do you have any notes about the minor settlements of Denzar or Surag in Thay? #realmslore
If not, I'll populate them with my own headcanon. :39 PM · Jan 6, 2023 
+_> 1)
Surag is a small but crowded community of steep slopes covered with steeper cobbled lanes and multi-storey homes, in a rocky bowl where the Surag River tumbles into Lake Thaylambar. Or rather, used to tumble, ere 
+_> 2)
Thayans built many water-powered mills here: stamping mills for ore, grist mills for producing flour, and fulling mills to produce good fabric. Most Suraghran are millers or “tinkerers” who keep the fills running, and there 
+_> 3) are guards posted against brigands and “prowling beasts down out of the mountains” (monsters do follow the Surag River in search of food). It’s a place of order, watchful policing by soldiers, small but good inns, and 
+_> 4) eateries, but no taverns (inn guests drink at inns, and workers drink at home; taverns were long ago outlawed in the then-village as “places of brawls and trouble”).
Later, as Surag expanded, paddocks appeared on the 
+_> 5) gently-rolling hills around the river gorge, for caravan assembly and camping, and to pen sheep shorn here for their wool. Then sheep and goat slaughtering began, candlemaking, and the smoking of meat for transport elsewhere. 
+_> 6)
So Surag has long been a materials and food supply center for Eltabbar. To government officials, it was a handy place to rush friends and relatives to, if they got caught up in a scandal, and it still serves that purpose. 
+_> 7)
Which has made it a center for cynics (if not rebels) who detest what Thay is becoming, and the corruption that riddles it now. Another good reason for Suraghran to drink (and snarl complaints) at home.

Spellfire’s not a bug, to Mystra. Remember, she’s all about EVERYONE using magic, eventually. Spellfire is a “wild talent” where “just plain folks” get to harness the raw power of the Weave the same (except almost always untutored, or less tutored) as her Chosen  
+_> 2) get to wield the silver fire. If spellfire use erupts everywhere, we’re closer to Mystra’s goal. She steps in when individuals use magic to coerce others, to keep them from having/using magic.

?_> [@] Good evening! There’s been debate among my fanbase regarding Dragons in Faerûn after my character gave birth to Half-Dragon children so I wanted to ask: Are Dragons classified as reptiles by scholars in the Realms or do they have their own classification eg. Draconic? 
?_> [@] [@] Thankfully we have a handy dandy chart for this. Dragons are straight Ys down the board, while Kobolds and Lizardfolk are significantly more restricted in terms of cross-species compatibility. Thus we can assume that Dragons are significantly different from reptiles on that basis [:]

+_> [@] They actually had that much in liquid assets. Archmages learn that they need lots of cash to buy expensive spell components, and when they can demand and get lots of cash for casting crucial spells for rulers and guilds and merchant costers

?_> [@] Couldn't you theoretically try to reduce the quality of healing potions by targeting certain ingredients for them, thus forcing healers to use inferior replacements? 
+_> [@] Theoretically, yes, but there are far too many different recipes to target all the ingredients.
And many of the ingredients are either very common, so substitution is easy, or hard to find/harvest, so you'd spend all your waking time trying to find and destroy them.

+_> [@] [@] Exactly. There's a huge difference between drow communities (like Menzo) in Lolth's thrall, and all drow. There are many drow who do not reverence the Spider Queen, and don't live with warring houses led by matrons.
One must always be mindful of whose voice Realmslore comes from. 
+_> [@] [@] In Menzo, there were drow who knew the words for love, but never dared use them. Zak, and various brothers and sisters who dared feel affection for each other despite the sisters being culturally the "enforcers" upon their brothers, or the same between parents and children.

All dwarves of the Realms are more hirsute than the average human.

MOST female dwarves, if they do nothing at all to their hair, naturally have sideburns, some curving into chin-edge fringes.

?_> Hey there [@] - do you have any notes about the minor settlements of Denzar or Surag in Thay? #realmslore
If not, I'll populate them with my own headcanon. 
+_> 1)
Sure. Denzar is a mining supply (food, picks, mules, etc.) and processing center (where raw ore is crushed and smelted) serving small, hand-worked mines dotted throughout Gauros. These diggings yield mostly copper, but some
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) lead and silver, and a trickle of gold. So Denzar is a place of plumes of sulphurous smoke from the furnaces, huge piles of firewood carted in, complaining oxen and mules and their handlers, rubblestone-walled buildings, and 
+_> 3) hard drinking. Outcasts, misfits, and crossbreeds are recruited for mining here, and mended if they survive mining injuries. It’s a rough, frontier place, and Red Wizards, effete nobles, and other too-wealthy, too-snobbish 
+_> 4)
Thayans are sullenly disliked. Your typical hardened miner can fell your typical Thayan veteran soldier with one punch, and tear apart (and crush all the joints of) your rank-and-file undead Thayan soldier in short order. 
+_> 5)
Even powerful Red Wizards should watch their backs. A spellcaster with his skull smashed like a dropped egg rarely casts effective retaliatory spells.

Sure! The Twelve from Thay met their end in the early autumn of the Year 992 DR (the Year of the Watching Helm). They were one of many groups (“strike forces,” if you will) sent out from Thay in that time by ambitious zulkirs seeking to establish Thayan toeholds  
+_> 2) in many lands; farflung outposts for spying and storage, recovery refuges for traveling Red Wizards. (Not to be confused with the later “trading enclaves” established across Faerûn by Thay.)
Initially seen as a great way to establish Thayan reach without much 
+_> 3) investment, and to keep ambitious Red Wizards busy to boot, the notion fell into disfavour because so many attempts to seize these toeholds resulted, immediately or eventually, in Red Wizards lost—and no toeholds gained or at least kept.
The Twelve were all  
+_> 4) human males from the tharch of Eltabbar, sent forth by the Zulkir of Evocation/Invocation and well equipped with battle-useful magic items (see the footnote at the bottom of Page 95 of the Volo’s Guide). We know that two dominant mages led them but were

It had the effect of thinning the ranks of higher level casters of arcane magic, yes, but no one intended that. It arose due to the slayer of Mystra not understanding or believing her true nature (that she IS the Weave), perhaps arrogantly dismissing that as

?_> Good morrow, [@] !
Does it ever snow in Thay? (The non-magical kind, mind ye. .) 
+_> 1)
Yes. Often in the high areas (Thaymount, and the slopes of the Sunset Mountains), uncommonly on the plateau (“High Thay”) where hoar frosts and brief sleet storms are more common than snow that falls and stays (except where
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) the sun doesn’t directly reach), and rarerly elsewhere.
In Thay, ground fogs at night due to day/night temperature differences are more common than “real” precipitation, and snow or summer rain, real precipitation tends to be 
+_> 3) brief. Sometimes heavy, but short-lived due to moving fast. It keeps humidity down, and Thayans used to being able to see the “front” (a wall or plume of falling rain) of a storm approaching, or receding into the distance. 
+_> 4)
That’s natural weather, before the Red Wizards start casting spells to affect the weather for agricultural reasons. They favor steady downpours at night, soaking rains for crops that also hamper marauding monsters, brigands

It depends on what you mean by “best
In the 1490s DR, the shipbuilders who can make the most luxurious large ships are Anabravvur’s of Selgaunt, in Sembia (third generation firm, current head: Alpharra Anabravvur (unwed thirty-six-year-old albino woman, smart 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) as a whip, coldly clear-headed, and VERY rich and well-connected in Sembia). They’re expensive, and so busy that they can afford to take their time (if you complain as a client, they just shrug; they’ve so much business waiting that they don’t care if they  
+_> 3) lose a client. Or six.) Their vessels are beautiful, elegantly designed, and superb in materials and workmanship.
If you want the fastest makers of rugged top-quality ships, when looks don’t matter but durability and seaworthiness in storms does, your best  
+_> 4) choice of shipbuilders will be Marhymbel House Shipways of Sarshel, in Impiltur, run by the brothers Ilund and Vromur Marhymbel, a second-generation firm who always “overbuild” for strength.
And if you want value for money (cheap, good, and fairly quick)  
+_> 5) you’d likely want to do business with that old, sarcastic martinet Arkheld Kolnarrbeir of Marsember, in Cormyr, who’s assembled a diverse-race crew of old, veteran shipbuilders and the best non-magical drydock cranes in existence.

?_> [@] Noble sir Ed, I hope you are doing good these days, and as you helped so much before on Thay and Netheril, another language related question.
How will be "friend" in gitzerai? 
+_> 1)
Githzerai say “zatha” when they mean friend, and zuu is lover, zanama is family, zathav is group of friends who hang out together or are working on something together or who share a common interest), whereas abruu is a personal foe, and luruu are a group of 
Realmslore [:] 
+_> 2) beings you are enemies of
Githzerai usually, in relaxed normal converse, begin with a subject, then a verb, then the rest of the sentence. So in English “The eel merchants kill I think we should go and hurriedly do them

Thu Feb 10 06:51:21 (Material Components)

?_> [@] [@] [@] What happens to the diamonds after they're used? Do the gods use them for stuff? 
?_> [@] [@] [@] Presumably they are used to channel divine power in a way that consumes their physical form? That's always been my assumption. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] That's what I figured too. Though I'm writing a short story set in the City of Judgement and had the idea of a diamond being used as payment for the release of the soul from the afterlife. So I was curious if there's a more a specific lore explanation already before I go with it. 
?_> [@] [@] [@] I'll be curious to hear if Ed has any specific lore to share in this regard! 
+_> [@] [@] [@] Unless a spell description specifically says otherwise, material components for an arcane spell are consumed (vaporized) in the casting. So the energy that created the gems (by heating and putting pressure on the rock) is released to power the spell, and the gems are gone.

?_> [@] I thank you for the clarification. I'll push my luck Illiph Traun resembles a demilich to us, but is named alternatively "lichnee" and "lich lord" by Fzoul and the beholders.
Was he a demilich, or are lich lords their own critter? Did Fzoul mean something specific by lichnee? 
+_> [@] "Lichnee" is a collective term (like "football fan" or "angler") for anyone who has attained lichdom. A "lich lord" is any sort of advanced lich who became so by their own actions, as opposed to having it happen to them through time and the actions of others.

?_> Valerie Valusek told me this took her FIVE MONTHS!
Waterdeep from AD&D 1st City System book in 1988 is🔥 🔥 🔥!!!
It was EIGHT FULL PAGES. I have them here photoshopped together. View this as large as you can, the detail down to the houses is off the charts good!
DnD [:] 
?_> [@] [@] I'm confused by that illustration, seems like terrible city planning (why build your walls 100 yards away from a perfect defensive cliff?). And the sea seems to be on a plateau above the surrounding land 
+_> [@] [@] Waterdeep sits on the flattened-by-human-excavation inland spurs of Mount Waterdeep, in its lee (it shelters the city against fierce storms from the sea). The city occupies a defensible plateau (that slopes south to the harbour), avoiding mountain slopes too steep to be built on. 
+_> [@] [@] As for the sea, it occupies a submerged plateau or six, but is below the level of the city. A very good thing, considering the condition of the sewers.

In my 1490s DR notes, I put the number of loyal Red Wizards (as opposed to exiles like those in our recent Thay book) at 3,950, but that includes apprentices/novices who'd never be "allowed out" yet (can't have the public see weak Red Wizards and get ideas).

+_> [@] I play in Greyhawk, too, in Jay Scott's online campaign, and craft new Oerth lore as well as Realmslore for Gabbin' shows with him and Anna Meyer. But the Realms will always be my home.

?_> [@] Mastery of the craft. You’re an example of that “10,000 hours” principle. Great stuff. Thank you!

The knack is to put your head into the Realms, to think of things and see things as if you lived there, and it's all real.
Then when something "doesn't fit," it sticks out, and you can generate lore details that weave it into the grand tapestry so it belongs.

No plums so a morningfeast from the Dalelands today: blanching and peeling tomatoes and slowly cooking onions, garlic and anchovies together. #cooking in the #ForgottenRealms.
And on another hob onion leek soup and fry bread #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms.
Now adding peeled tomatoes with salt and hot pepper paste and squeeze of lime and paprika to the softened onions. Mix and cover to stew on low until tomatoes liquify. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms.
Eggs. Cream. Spices. Cook constantly moving until almost done. It will continue cooking when you remove eggs from the pan. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms.
Here we go. Illistyl Elventree’s morningfeast served at the Twisted Tower of Ashaba. Spiced eggs drowned in tomato sauce, fry bread, a bowl of onion soup, and some salty grilled tomatoes to top the bread with. Dalelands food is nice. #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms. [@] am I close to the meal from spellfire (I believe?).
YES. Looks mouth-watering. Bravo.
And yes, Dales food is rib-sticking, hearty rural fare. Comfort food for many. Leftovers great for later meals (up seasoning as texture goes south and watery-ness increases). of course, i had no access to black sausage in my area :).

But I have to say - how the third book ended. .killed me. Did u (do u) like how it ended & have you thought about revisiting Shandril and Narm?
No. I was editorially ordered to do that, and hated the way the wordcount prevented me writing scenes of Narm dealing with what happened, and Shandril using the Weave to reach him, in his mind.
I would love to revisit them, but there's no legal route to doing so, right now.

Been combing through old Volo's Guides and Aurora's whole realms catalogue for information on regional cuisines, food preferences, delicacies, and spirits, and finding very sparse information. Leaves me not much to go on here. [@] Your input would be huge!
I have the 3rd edition Campaign Setting, players guide, and races of Faerun if there's something specific you're interested in.
I want to know what the people of various places *like* to eat and drink, which is a lot different than “what exists”. I don’t think the info I’m looking for is in any setting book, maybe novels I guess.
Thayan cuisine is covered in the Thay/Land of the Red Wizards book [@] and [@] and I wrote (DM's Guild) and I've covered the cuisine of just about everywhere in the Realms, down the years. Please look at [@] 's Realms cooking posts here on Twitter!

Dragon #75 contains the first of a seminal series of articles by [@] describing the Nine Hells. It is also the first issue with Roger Moore on staff as an editor.
Great illustration this, but one thing that bothered me .what type of devil IS the recently-slain critter in this drawing??
That’s a pan devil, sometimes called a “satyr devil” by humans (=superficial resemblance to satyrs). They’re messenger devils used by the archdevils (think: Tolkien’s Wormtongue). I should write them up properly, as it occurs to me they never got official coverage.
Yeah I don't recall seeing them anywhere! (though I missed 3/3.5e). PS: How did you end up taking over writing up the 9 hells dukes? Did you just take up where EGG left off or did he hand over some aspects to flesh out?
I asked Kim Mohan (then assistant editor of TD) if he wanted me to write up the Nine Hells (the "Politics of Hell" article by my friend Alex von Thorn in TD #17 had been a huge hit) and Kim eagerly said yes. So I wrote it up, Kim took it to Gary for approval, it was given: done.

But where is Ulvur's Lane in BG? hmm
On the so-nicely-annotated BG 5e map, find “Gond Gate.” The street running along the S side of the wall (through the G of Gond) is Ulvur’s Lane. The House Of The Lute is the easternmost of the two side-by-side rectangle buildings due W of the gap between the two G’s.

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1673014075515699217 [@] Hi Ed. In the DD Triangle Saga, there is a scene involving Khelban and Madeiron. Khelban has erected protection spells around himself to research uninterrupted. Madeiron physically pushed through the spells to grab him and surprised Khelban. Was this impressive?
Oh, yes. Madeiron was wearing a wardbreaker ring (think of those implements used to break car windows so you can get out) that works on wards, mantles, walls of force, and spheres (as in: prismatic), but the feat of strength to push through was still astonishing.

Also, Ed wanted to ask you yesterday but forgot. Is there a shrine to Finder somewhere in BG?
Yes. Same lovely BG map: go to the Y of the big “LOWER CITY” map tag, and look up the street that runs under the Y’s southern arm and angles to the Basilisk Gate. The little square building on its north side, just before Ascloakan’s Fine Inn, is 
The Fool’s Altar (shrine to Finder).
Ascloakan’s Fine Inn is the large building that faces the Gate, between the aforementioned angled street (Hammaskarl’s Ride) and the street that runs under the “T” of “CITY” in the LOWER CITY tag (which is 
Talankar’s Lane; the Elfsong Tavern also fronts on the Lane, farther west).

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1674135682569076736 [@] Can I ask please, good sir, what other unusual spells may be in the spellbook of the Royal Magician of Cormyr, if you would, we know that 'Change Noble to Feline' is in there traditionally but I wonder what other wonders could be found, please? (Sorry if double post)
Heh. Here are a FEW of the spells the Royal Magician knows:
Forcewave (thunderwave-like fast-moving wall of force, melts when touching walls and other inorganic things, but slams full-force into organic, and absorbs other spells as fuel)
Greater Mindream (undamaging, fairly stealthy thought-reading, lasts hours and can switch targets if precise location known, can see and hear what target does, requires no ongoing concentration)
Teleport Token (unerringly translocate a prepared by-the-caster magical token, like a feather token, from a known spot (secure storage) to an envisaged one (familiar shelf or niche, or the hand of a known person)
Awaken Crystal Grot Guardians
Close the Gates of High Horn
Confer Wraithform (upon a known recipient who need not be willing or prepared, up to six hundred miles away, affects all their gear AND anyone touching them)

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1674266011497889794 [@] I have a Forgotten Realms question. I've found a few sources that describe a constellation called "Amaunator's belt" that's visible from the Spine of the World in the summer.
What does the constellation look like? Is it's an FR analog to Orion's belt?
I don't do real-world analogues in the Realms (though some others do). Orion's Belt is an arc of three bright stars close together, whereas "Amaunator's Belt" is a phrase some lore-sages apply to a constellation more often called (by folk of the Sword Coast 
North) as "the Lake Eye" (and many other names in various cultures, over time). It's distinctive, and looks like a horizontal diamond (the eye) touching a parallel horizontal oval (the reflection of the eye in the waters of an imaginary celestial lake).
The "Amaunator's Belt" nickname comes from Amaunator's portfolio of time, and the belief that a time gate can be located by reference to this constellation.
And, as usual, if you seek longer Realmslore answers, the place to go is the Greenwood's Grotto server on Discord, in particular the q4ed thread (or the vip-castle thread for Patreon supporters) or join my Patreon, where I ladle out the #Realmslore at full length!
Looking back, I see I forgot to mention the most important part: the (lower) oval of stars that some see as the Eye's reflection is called Amaunator's Belt by sages.

Are there any named clergy members at the Finder's shrine there? (fingers crossed for a lone saurial)
Why, yes:
Aszloakh the Hooded (so-nicknamed because he always wears a hood-up weathercloak when out of doors, in the Gate). A finhead saurial of deep, rumbling voice, patient calm even when threatened, and long holy service. Views human foibles with cynical good  humor, expects deceit and treachery (and is seldom disappointed).
He carries some sort of staff that has magical powers, but my source (Elminster) knows not exactly what it is.

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1675594505838272512 [@] where are the most productive mines of Alum (used to fix colors in fabric) in the Realms?
Heh. I got asked this very thing by a TSR staff designer in 1987. Then as now, the answers are: in the northslope Smoking Mountains just west of Gilgirn in Unther, in the eastslope Dragonsword Mountains just south of halfway between the
Lonely Lake and Nezras, and in the southslope Wyrmbones on the southern edge of the Shaar (north of Halruaa).
The best alum mines of all are, however, in the westernmost coastal mountains (due west of Haelond) in Gontal, in
Laerakond. These deposits were recently discovered, and have greatly enriched formerly abandoned Haelond; it’s now a busy gleaning and shipping center, putting sacks of powdered and lump alum (a mineral salt) onto barges for transport down the River Orlaphar to Gontal (the city), for transshipment to ocean-going ships there.
In the Realms as in our real world, alum’s newest, and now bulk, use is as a mordant (binder, keeping the dye from washing out) in dyeing cotton and other woven fabrics. Its oldest use is medicinal, but its second oldest use is in pickling (foods, for preservation).
To all Realms fans reading this: explore Greenwood’s Grotto on Discord for in-depth Realmslore answers, or even better (because you can request coverage of specific topics, as well as getting glimpses of the Realms that will surprise you), check out my Patreon!
I want to know *why* a TSR staff designer wanted to know this in 1987. "For this module, we need a way to break a 'robe of scintillating colors' any ideas?" "I guess the PCs could use alum, but I'm not sure if it's found in that region
Designers were fascinated by a setting with sources for everything and shipping routes to markets. It answered the question of "what's in the wagons? The hold? Those sacks?" for the DM. So the questions were many. We could have wars over stuff, not just princesses.

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1676063950390132736 [@] when you initially created faerun, did you begin with a section of the world that your PCs played in, or did you have the entire continent mapped out?
I created Faerûn 10 years before D&D existed, building along the Sword Coast from Mirabar S to Waterdeep as I followed the travels of Mirt the Moneylender in my earliest short stories. Though my very first tale told me Zirta stood inland. So, yes, it grew.
Wow! Thanks for the response and thank you for the insight!
My pleasure.
Waterdeep was already mapped and detailed when the 1st Realms D&D campaign started there. For my 2nd campaign, I jumped to Eveningstar in Cormyr (the Haunted Halls), and the PCs soon traveled to Shadowdale. From those two foci, the detailing went in all directions.
Sir any chance those stories see the light of day(or already have)?
Most of them were published in the 1960s and 1970s. Since the Realms became a D&D setting, the first story was republished: "One Comes, Unheralded, to Zirta" (GenCon handout, then in The Best of the Realms II: The Stories of Ed Greenwood mass market paperback).

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1676614377825345536 [@] in 1371DR what would it take to gate JUST the Yawning Portal & those in it to the Demi-Plane of Shadow? Temporarily of course.
Asking for a friend.
Messy.
Ahem, to amplify just a little: to do that, you'd have to breach a hole in, or break outright, the wards of Waterdeep.
Picture a pancake (the surface city) balanced on a grille of three widely-spaced bars (the wards), atop a pit (Undermountain).
To pluck a dime-shaped piece out of the pancake, using tweezers or tongs, and pull it away (removing the Yawning Portal), is going to tug on the pancake.
With a high chance of it falling between the bars of the grille, down into the pit.
Which is why the wards are designed to resist any such endeavour.

Nowadays (1490s DR), most of them call themselves Arrauhau [pronounced “Ar-AW-haw”], which means “the People
Ed, is that a Common or Chondathan word they use?
Neither; it's their own. However, they would use it when referring to themselves collectively, to a speaker of Common, so it's slowly entering Common.

I'm becoming very disheartened about WoTC burning their book & going solely to digital subs.
No, you can use any rules system that suits your FRP group to play in the Realms.
Wizards has blurred setting and game boundaries in recent years, making the two seem inseparable, but 
And I would remind the "but how do you convert this character build to another system crowd that characters IN THE REALMS don't know about game rules and statistics and Rules As Written. If the DM wants to wing it and substitute or change on the fly, it shouldn't hurt the roleplaying/acting experience at all

https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1678944167387357185 [@] I'm on the Forgotten Realms Wiki bc I have a priestess of Umberlee and she's by no means a novice and I was wondering if the titles listed here were in order of rank or if they're all equal bc we have a Wavelord and he's the head of the temple
In the 1490s DR, the Church of Umberlee remains chaotic in the sense that ranks, titles, and vestments vary from temple to temple across Toril.
However, the list of titles you cite is in rough rank order, so yes, a Wavemistress or a Wavelord would head a temple.
Here's a rank order followed in many temples of Umberlee on the Sword Coast, lowest to highest: Untaken (novices, no rank)/Tide Rider (accepted into the clergy, lowest-ranked of priests; "Rider" in short)/Breaking Wave ("Wave")/Flood Tide ("Tide")/Dark Breaker  ("Breaker" in colloquial shortform)/Puissant Undertow ("Under" and also marking the highest church rank considered "underpriests," with all higher rank being "senior clergy")/Wave of Fury ("Varrwave")/Savage Seawind ("Wind")/Wavemistress and Wavelord (never  shortened, and equal in rank to each other).
In SOME temples, a novice is a 1st level cleric, a Rider is a 2nd, a Wave is 3rd, a Tide is 4th, a Breaker is 5th, an Under is 6th, a Varrwave is 7th, a Wind is 8th, and the temple head can be any level above that.
The "level gap" between 9th level and whatever level the Wavelord or Wavemistress (and there are more of the latter than the former, in this faith) is filled with specialized temple rank titles (in ascending rank order: infirmarer, cellarer, steward, and prior  [who's also head of temple security/internal discipline within the clergy]), plus several others between cellarer and steward, if the temple is large enough.
However, it's unwise to think that this rank structure is followed clearly at every temple of Umberlee.
Varrwave" is derived from a long-ago Wavemistress, Varra Himril, who ordered her temple that way and named the rank after herself (with the typical humility of this priesthood [=sarcasm]).
If you see "Dread" in front of a church title, it means the holder is a 
Waveservant or True Servant of the Wave (specialty priest subclasses who have their own personal pledges and oaths to the goddess, who can possess their bodies at will and work or speak directly through them).

Do you have a recommendation for an interactive/digital map for the Forgotten Realms?
I’ve been using FR fandom/wiki for details
And the interactive maps on the FR Wiki are the best for small, localized areas (like the city of Baldur's Gate). There are at least two superb interactive Waterdeep maps out there. Wizards has an online Sword Coast map drawn by Mike Schley that's beautiful but missing a lot of features. Markustay has done superb crammed-full-of-all-the-places maps of various parts of Faerûn in the 3e era, so they're the best for locating villages, hamlets, the names of small streams, etc.

Most traders and travelers think of that area as "the Uthgardt lands," and call it the "Uthgardt Hills" or "Wild Hills" or "where the Barbarians hunt
It's rolling country of scrub woods, small bogs and ponds, brooks and rills (tiny streams) running everywhere.
Yes, that dwarven realm stretches from the coast along the river that runs through Neverwinter, east to the Goblintide, and north to the valley of Khedrun, so underlies much of that area.

Evidently, TSR they didn't his exact maps for Undermountain and added a lot themselves, but sure I would love Ed's yarn spinning on this :D :D
Yes. My maps for Undermountain were what I considered "realistic" meaning there were clusters of rooms, then passages leading to other clusters, not "geomorphs" filling in every inch of a page. TSR crammed in Dave Sutherland's Empire Of The Petal Throne maps & more.
As they didn't want to publish maps with big black "solid rock" areas (or insets). So they used a small core of my level maps, leading from the Yawning Portal shaft.

One more question. In the 3rd ed Forgotten Realms Campaign guide it mentions that anyone sufficiently dedicated can use psionics. Does that mean that psionics doesn't require "The Gift" like Arcane magic does?
Yes. The mind can be developed, usually with guidance if any precise control is desired. Good tutors who aren't VERY dangerous to pupils are, however, rare.
Whereas if you lack the Gift, you just can't wield the Art, except by triggering items enchanted by others.
Is The Gift another way of referring to ability scores (Int, Charisma) or is it more esoteric than that?
The Gift is the ability to wield the Art (arcane magic). It has nothing directly to do with game stats (D&D came along a decade after the Realms).
Thanks so much for the responses. My next character is absolutely going be someone who became a psychic because they couldn't be a wizard.

got another question for you. In 2nd Edition, the Tome of Magic made several references to Wild Mages shaping Raw Magic. Is that to say that Wild Mages delve directly into Raw Magic without the Weave? If so, can Wild Mages function in a dead magic zone?
Raw Magic” is the energy continually rushing through the Weave (the natural energies of the earth). So, no, NOT “without the Weave” because they are Wild MAGES (i.e. using arcane magic = the Weave). So, no, Wild Mages can’t use any magic in a dead magic zone.

The Trade Way is flourishing, and always has been. Don't be misled by the maps. It "peters out" because that stretch of countryside allows wagons to go anywhere, so every caravan takes its own route to discourage bandits, avoid ruts from earlier caravans, etc.

[@] Thank you so much! Looked all over for "blossom" in FR Elvish, then found this tweet. Going in the name of a homebrew moonblade for a powerful cleric (Sunite-like, but She's been replaced in this story). Now back to coming up with the rest of a good name! [@] If it's possible, I can't seem to find a Faerûnian Elvish word that means something on the order of dawn, daybreak, sunrise. I'm going for a sort of "flower of daybreak" feeling in the blade's name. Thanks in advance if you see this!
Calam is sunrise, and aulauth is flower in the blossom (right) sense, so “Aulauthycalam” (“All-LOTH-ee-KAHL-am”) is literally ‘flower of sunrise
Daybreak” is unknown in Elvish, but louah (“LOO-ah”) is dawn, so you could also have the blade be named Aulauthlouah.

im making stirge on toast this weekend coz i'm traveling back home and won't have time - is making bread egg-soaked and a morningfeast - lore friendly? I think is plausible. What do you think Ed [@] ?
In the Dales, upland Sembia, Cormyr and along the Heartlands trade routes west as far as Scornubel, what Brits in our world call “eggy bread” (savory NOT sweet French toast) is a breakfast staple among farm folk. Seasoned with crushed dill or diced chives, or failing that fresh parsley and a pinch of salt and pepper. Taverns and inns serve this with strips of bacon and/or a slab of sharp cheese (like strong cheddar); the hot wet eggy bread is often laid atop the cheese to partially melt it, so they stick, with seasonings trapped between.
But what about stirges on it?
If you can get blood pudding, or blood sausage, the taste is pretty close to stirge.
Failing that, get some mild pepperettes, slice them in half, and fry them. Fallback is fried thin-sliced Spam but you MUST coat with HP sauce and black pepper to cut the sweetness.
I’m using the recipe you shared in Ed Greenwood presents 😉 going to make sauce from scratch
That works! (BTW, for non-culinary, not-Brit readers, "HP sauce" is Houses of Parliament sauce (a brown sauce: tamarind and tomatoes main ingredients).

This post by Ed Greenwood ([@] on Scornubel is awesome:
Time to spotlight a locale in the Realms that can serve as a home for your campaign for years to come, or just a favorite spot for your characters to return to, to sell, buy, and hire (often, no questions asked!).
Enjoy!

[@] Great Sage! If I am planning a deep dungeon that is a relic of ancient Imaskar, how much would your average adventurer know as "common knowledge" of the ancient empire in 1496 DR?
That long, LONG ago, there was an ancient empire, mighty in magic (and that had complex plumbing!) named Imaskar, and its folk were the Imaskari, and there was something called "High Imaskar" and that's about it.

[@] I feel you may be the fastest resource in this regard !! Is there any figure that was either a general or commander who would have traveled or campaigned from the East of Faerun to the coast anywhere between 900-1200 DR? I’m looking for a good historical figure, ha!
Hmmm. The best-known at the time example would be the mercenary “captain” (she commanded her own in-demand mercenary force) Ilhaera Maraztrel of Talathat (in Murghôm). She’s why “Ilhaerans” [pronounced “Ill-HAIR-ans”] are regarded as great mercenaries to this day. She was a human female (long black hair, flashing green eyes, nutbrown skin, fierce temper but iron resolve and self-control, and an uncannily-accurate horse archer with rippling-muscled shoulders as a result of that, so her shafts went astonishing distances with piercing force). Relocated to Madan and then Phannaskul, but her hirings often dragged her west, and she eventually dwelt in
Zazesspur, where she ended her days as a local “lady” of wealth and influence who refused to marry but took multiple lovers, and died in her eighth decade fighting raiding peryton (perishing “happily” according to witnesses).
And the best places to shoot me Realmslore queries like this are my Patreon (ed greenwood), or the q4ed channel on the Greenwood’s Grotto Discord, which is a great community of Realms fans where much lore can be found.

[@] silly question—how is Volo so old despite being a regular human? is there an artifact involved? did Elminster extend his lifespan as a prank?
This has been explained many times so here's the really short version: Volo has spent long years as a stone statuette or other forms, or in stasis, or trapped in magic items (often as punishments from angry mages). He's (unwittingly) a Weave anchor, so Azuth and Mystra guard him. oh right duh! I totally forgot the Weave anchor bit—thanks so much for taking the time to give me a quick overview and thanks for your rad work! hope you had a fantastic GenCon!
I did, thanks!
And it's always a pleasure to serve up Realmslore.
Elminster and other servitors of Mystra and of Azuth are Volo's guardian angels, or he'd have earned his own demise CENTURIES ago.

While playing Baldur’s Gate 3 I came across a poisonous vent and needed something to cover it. While scrolling through my inventory I FOUND A WHOLE-ASS GOBLIN CORPSE IN MY BACKPACK it worked splendidly how do you get a goblin in your backpack?
I must’ve been in a looting frenzy and shoved that bitch in there i have no idea how to get a goblin in my inventory tho like how do you do that?
Select it, look at possible actions and you should see an option to pick it up
I need to start collecting pocket goblins to throw at stuff now thank you for the idea
Throw at stuff? Miss me with that.
Snacks for the road.
Tossing a goblin corpse at someone is the traditional Zhentarim greeting
In deepest Chult, not offering a properly dry-aged corpse to one's guests is an unforgivable breach of the laws of hospitality and brings terrible shame on all involved.
In some Rashemi tribes it is considered impolite if you don't bash your host in the face with a dismembered goblin arm or leg and I'm sure [@] would back me up on this
Nowadays, a gentle tap is considered polite. "Bash" is so 1300s DR.
Unless you're signalling an eagerness for intimacy, that is.
Ed thank you for joining our fun discussion on the many uses for miscellaneous goblin parts in traditional greetings across The Realms
My pleasure!
And I see you haven't yet touched on the genuine widest use of goblin parts: sharpened and pierced and used as sewing needles, or as pen nibs, by many beings (including goblins) right across Faerûn.

Very nice. I'm going to put this on one scroll in a dungeon. Other than Ed of the Greenwoods, what is the name of a poet of the realms who penned, er quilled this work?
With rare exceptions, I keep my doggerel apart from the Realms for legal reasons, but IF this was a Faerûnian poet, it'd likely be Ardanthra Rosetel of Silverymoon, or Jalastra Raendeem of Castle Ward, Waterdeep. Or maybe (when playful) Relve Hormatar of Athkatla.

[@] When a mage from another world without the Weave or an equivalent (perhaps one from the Inner Planes) comes to Toril, are they forced to cast through manipulation of the Weave instead? Or can they cast with their own methods as usual?
They can cast with their own methods. (Some spells may not work, or may vary in effects or duration.) The Weave is the "superhighway" conduit to accessing the raw energies of the world, but you can walk. Or take a dirt road through the fields. #realmslore

[@] Dragon Heist states that a Dragonward is keeping dragons outside of Waterdeep (besides Aurinax). But I'm finding sources of multiple dragons in Waterdeep in the 14th and 15th centuries. (Most sources from 3e). Is the Dragonward a new addition in 5e?
For example, apparently a steel dragon in the guise of a human (Jalanvaloss) lives in Waterdeep, and a blue dragon came to a Raptoran sorceress in Waterdeep seeking help. Did these characters circumvent the dragonward or is this a retcon? Thanks in advance.
I created the Dragonward before D&D existed (1968, if I recall correctly).
Tokens (enchanted items) and other means exist to circumvent or slip through the ward, and some of them have been covered in published Realmslore down the years. So, no, not a 5e addition.

With the NDA official lifted (in place since 1991), we just brought Susprina's story to YouTube! I'm so happy to finally be able to talk openly about Elminster's Mysterious Drow Apprentice, and what wonderful tale it is! dnd #realmslore
Oh, why was there an NDA?
Someone on staff at TSR intended to do a novel (or series of novels) featuring Susprina, so a "hands off" NDA was put in place. TSR as an entity is gone, that person is now deceased, and their then-boss confirmed that the NDA can now be considered retired.
I'm sorry they held a NDA over you for so long, but I'm also sorry that the person who passed away never got to write the story they wanted to tell.
Yes. That's the real regret. Time is now taking friend after colleague away from me. So many voices stilled, so many delights never shared.
Are you able to share what the idea they had was?
No, I never knew it.
I've never been on staff at TSR or Wizards, and some planning gets shared with me under NDAs, and most doesn't (companies guarding their IP).
And I thought they were dating lol
No. The Old Mage isn't quite the randy old goat his reputation implies

The many liches who serve Larloch trap intruders, enspell them to become agents for their many schemes, and send them back out into the world compelled to carry out their commands.
The liches are carrying out Larloch’s wishes, but also competing endlessly with each other, vying for more influence with Larloch. Considering his fate at the hands of the Srinshee, they’re in for a surprise.

We both did.
Well said my friend! Your research and hard work into the Nine Hells is still a favorite of mine to this day! what research

[@] A curiosity has beset me in just what exactly are the architectural hallmarks of Thay, are Arches common? Do they fall for the wizards favoured tower motif?
Arches are. See THAY Land of the Red Wizards, the book Alex Kammer, Alan Patrick, and I did (on DM's Guild, hardcover, soft, or e-). I cover Thayan architecture therein. Thayan mages have walled compounds with, yes, internal towers (attached to mansions).

Hi [@] I hope you've been well.
I had a question about nautiloids.
Could you eat it? Like, crashed mind flayer ship, those ship tentacles sure look tasty!
Sure. The tentacles are REALLY tough (like a thick callous) and bitter; properly marinated, taste like burnt almonds (LOTS of flesh, so bring friends).
Cook THOROUGHLY, or mind-links will survive, and mind flayers who controlled the tentacles will control YOU.

[@] what are the popular colors worn by priestess and priestesses of Eilistraee?
Throat to wrists & ankles: black with silver highlights (shoulders, nipples, elbows, knees, thighs) to represent moonlight.
Cloaks and overmantles: midnight blue (deep rich blue, one shade darker/more purple than royal blue, with random scattered TINY stars=sparkles).
Thank you so much. Do you know of any depictions of these followers in art? I ask because I want to make my Eilistraeean character look as authentic as possible.
Not that I can recall. Most artists went straight to the nekkid drow ladies dancing in a circle under the moonlight. I have my rough sketches somewhere in those two shipping containers

[@] Hi Mr. Greenwood 😁 I'm a still a bit new to DnD, but I read you're sometimes able to answer questions. I've been reading up on lore for the Baelnorn. My character has reason/need to learn all she can about them & how they're made. Could I leaner it in Candlekeep?
I created the baelnorn, and everyone else saw them first in the Ruins of Myth Drannor boxed set.
Yes, there are several tomes in Candlekeep that cover how elves become baelnorn. It is almost always a voluntary choice, to enter a lich-like state to exist beyond death as a guardian (in Myth Drannor, of family crypts, but elsewhere they serve as guardians of living kin, of communities they love, or of sites important to them, such as temples, groves sacred to a deity they are close to, and so on; some even function as trapmakers, or loremasters training living elves, particularly in spellcraft).
One usually becomes a baelnorn through participation in a High Magic or divine ritual (and it is these rituals that are recorded in rare and well-hidden books, such as those found in the reached-via-portals-only, bedrock-surrounded Inner Chambers of Candlekeep). They invariably require the assistance of other spellcasters.
The other ways of becomimg a baelnorn are via dedication rituals after achieving actual lichdom (phylactery and all) or through the divine boon of one of the Seldarine, usually granted only after fervent prayer or when an elf the deity has noticed and approves of the service of is stricken and dying, and to save them the Seldarine makes them a baelnorn.

Are there any child baelnorns? The thought is strange, but just whimsical enough that an elven deity might have made a child into one in a moment of inspiration or desperation, no?
It's possible, but highly unlikely. I don't know of any. Ethically and practically, a baelnorn should be one who's lived a long life (so, experienced, competent veteran) and is fully aware of the "forever" choice they're making. NOT someone whose life is before them.

[@] So, do the people in Faerûn speak English (as in: is "Common" English)? or is English just the language it is transported to us in the books (like e.g. in Lord of the Rings), and Common is just the language you the player speak, i.e. Spanish, Danish, German, etc.
For convenience, we make Common=English, but the Common Tongue in the Realms is like archaic English (prithee, etc.) with many local slang words and pronunciations (dialects). We translate, Common isn't literally English. But using English lets us do rhymes, etc.

[@] [@] I am just so confused by Baldur's Gate 3 and want some clarification on Balduran's race. Was he an elf or a human?
He was human. (See his entry in the FR Wiki.)
Thanks for replying! Actually, that's exactly why I am asking, because we have a debate over his race while editing the FR wiki. The Baldurs Gate 3 has murals painting him as an elf, while no former DND material specified his race. Should the [@] change the mural then?
Murals can reflect an artist's ideals (an elf making the mural wanted to claim him as an elf?), but although Balduran wasn't my creation, he's definitely been a human from his beginnings as a character; that featured in discussions re. his getting Gate investors.

By the 1490s DR, navigation on the various tributaries above the Pool of Yeven is only by very small open boats and nutshells (coracles), or barges, poled to hold against the current, or paddled to move with it. Below the Pool, barges and the equivalent of  real-world “York boats” and catamarans (two identical hulls, platform between with rudder), where the river was wider, but still shallow, and slower-moving than above the Pool.

The most straightforward way is to have the same hag who created the hexblood be the hag who has a pact with the dhampir. Likely a night hag, and it has to be “predatory” and the dhampir must share its hunger. (As a DM, I always favor a hunger for dreams as it leads to maximum storytelling possibilities.) [@] still on damphir theme:
It's possible (lorewise) for a Halfelf who got turned on a Damphir, but retained his good nature to keep his bond with his moonblade?
Yes. If his good nature is retained, and he's done nothing to disgrace his house (like feed on his kin without their permission) or any mission/purpose baked into the moonblade, that is.

Hi [@] ! One of my players asked me a question I wasn’t sure how to answer. What’s stopping a gunslinging Paladin from asking Gond to make gunpowder work again? Smokepowder gets dispelled and can leave one at the mercy of powerful spellcasters, which could be “fixed”!
Nothing at all is stopping the paladin from asking. The question is, will Gond do so?
And I'm thinking the answer is no.
Gond will save THAT "big change" for when it will tip the balance of power in his favor in the next crisis among the gods.
If gunpowder is neutralized by a spell Gond had Mystra incorporate into the weave, does that mean that gunpowder would work in a dead magic zone?
Yes. Gunpowder will flash and/or explode (if confined, as in a firearm or "bomb") in a dead magic zone. One more reason why Azuth's main task, work also carried out by his Chosen and Mystra's, is to eliminate dead magic zones by "reweaving" the Weave.

A weird world-building question for you, [@] How would the Githyanki view Thay and it's Red Wizards? Both seem to work on a sort of structured meritocracy (or mageocracy in Thay's case) and both serve an undead ruler aspiring to godhood.
This happened in the "home" Realms campaign: Githyanki being openly contemptuous of the "childish clumsiness" and misuse of power among the Red Wizards, as opposed to being dedicated unwaveringly to a cause/mission.
The other pot/kettle is always blacker

Hi, [@] for #Cooking in the #ForgottenRealms i'm working on Kedgeree next - beef, ham, taters, and parsnips in green simmersauce. Where in the realms is it most commonly eaten? It sounds like something from the Dalelands and Silver Marches. Also, what is a good garnish?
It’s most commonly eaten along the Heartlands overland trade routes (Scornubel, Elturgard, Berdusk, Iriaebor, easternmost Amn, the Sunset Vale, Priapurl, Elversult, and Teziir), though it’s spread to the Dales, the Silver Marches, the Vilhon Reach’s southern  shore and the lands south of that, as far as (and including) the Border Kingdoms. It’s still spreading, via caravan merchants, along the trade routes.
Rosemary is one good garnish, and so is lemon pepper (but go easy on the latter).
The green simmersauce is like real-world green curry
I wonder if there is anything akin to South Carolina style hash which has an interesting history.
If you mean South Carolina Barbecue Hash, yes, but. .I’ve eaten so many variants, I’d better specify: in the Realms, such a hash is thick, not runny, and includes all the “bits and pieces” of hogs, like tongue and the rest of the head meat and brains, kidneys and hearts (but not trotters; they went into other dishes). Like South Carolina hash, this sort of hash in the Realms has potatoes and usually onions (or leeks, or shallots) in it, as well as mustard, garlic, and some hot spices—but the seasoning mix varies  widely from cook to cook; this is a way to use up leftovers.
In the real world, I’ve usually had such a hash served over rice, and this would be done in the Realms, too, but often in the Realms this dish is served over green beans or cabbage or other greens  (like diced artichokes or even sunchokes) that are otherwise bland and bulky. Tomatoes may even get included, though this is detested by some diners.
This hash in the Realms goes by various local names, the most popular of which include Hoghall (shortened  from Hog’s-all-for-the-dining-hall), brownback, yellowfire, and goldcloak.

I was wondering [@] if there is some equivalent to John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who creates sandwich in order to gamble late into the night?
In both Cormyr and Waterdeep, there have been nobles who long ago adopted the custom of eating “handpies” (think Cornish pasties: savory pastries filled with cooked meals) filled and seasoned to their tastes and not overly messy to eat (so, thick syrupy sauces or none at all, not watery/runny) so they could pursue various pastimes away from their home dining halls (or country lodge feasting tables). However, none of these are celebrated for innovations in the thinking of “present-day” Realmsfolk, either during the  s DR or the 1400s DR; cities across Faerûn adopted handpies as street food for laborers and shopkeepers centuries ago.
The closest we come to the Earl of Sandwich (as in, a noble remembered for a lasting food innovation named for him) in the Realms is a  certain Lady Calyth “Steeldance” Ebonhawk (pronounced “Kh-AL-ith” and the nickname came from her habit of donning silvered plate armor to dance in at revels, rather than gowns, which kept many dance partners at bay), a woman of spirit and whimsical sense of  humor. She liked to eat highly-seasoned pastes of minced meat, with a dessert of cinammon-flavored almond paste, but hated to sit down and interrupt what she was doing to dine, so she had servants follow her with wine to hand her goblets of, as she requested, and wore a belt-satchel containing leaf-wrapped (to guard against spillage; she didn’t eat the leaves) mussel-shells that had been emptied of their mussels, washed and dried, and then stuffed with either the meat paste (think: deviled ham with  very-finely-diced pickles) or the cinammon-almond paste). She’d dig out a shell, part its halves with a thumb, use her fingers to scoop the paste into her mouth, lick her finger clean, and go on with her day, slaking her thirst with wine.
These snacks are known as “calyths” to this day, and many noble ladies still do this, though the habit hasn’t spread outside the ranks of Cormyrean nobility (and copycat Sembian “wannabe” nobles).
However, many traveling merchants and cooks know what a calyth is.
Mr. Greenwood, I bow to your excellent worldbuilding.
Now I have an idea of what kinds of snack foods to serve in the fantasy casino once it gets running!
Ah! Casino! All the best gambling houses on the Sword Coast, Marsember, and Sembia also serve spiced clams: steamed in the shell, open shells kept warm submerged in poultry broth until served. As served, adorned with a smear of curried thock-sauce (like hummus).

Correct! Not all Chosen are anchors. Most anchors aren't beings, but items (the more immobile, the better) like the Athora. Beings are mobile and hopefully hidden-in-nature anchors but, yes, not all Chosen are anchors.

One question for Ed Greenwood. Can Weave Anchors (except living beings like the Chosen) have additional or hidden magical abilities/functions (like artifacts and multiple spell-laden magical items) and with some research and experimentation be activated when conditions or  command activating words are met. I can see spell glyphs or even Living Spells residing in area that are Weave Anchors.
Oh, yes. Many of them do. The Athora, for instance, makes all of Thay magical. Moonwells, and sacred groves, have their own innate magic. That's the very thing that makes them suitable as Weave Anchors.

No, but they are asked to do so by some of M's clergy. There's an ongoing debate, sometimes fierce, about how much personal animosity and gain plays into such directives, as opposed to the god's wishes. (Maglubiyet is a whimsical, capricious change-mind-often deity.)

Asmodeus has occasionally taken serpent shape, large and small.
I'm not sure what you mean by "outer realms," but although he likes to paint himself as a master controller, Asmodeus struggles to even shape, let alone create, the layers of the Hells.

I assume that Gale from BG3 knowing as much about him as he does is NOT common then?
Was he known about before the time of troubles by mortals?,
Yes, by sages and the Chosen of Mystra and all deities and many senior clergy of many gods. To other mortals, he was the stuff of minstrels' tall tales.

[@] hey Ed! I had a commission of an Eilistraee Paladin/cleric based on your specifications (Hair color was my choice). How close does it look to your mind's eye? Her name is Nightshade.
Great!
As I said in the Grotto, Eilistraeean helmets have overlapping metal-plate “skirts” out back, like flowing, unbound long hair between “behind the wearer’s ears” and a curved, hawkbeak-like protruding nose out front, with brow-ridges to match to shield the  wearer’s eyes in battle. Chin-straps with gorgets, always.

I love the tressym.
Also, what are the origins of the tressym?
I lost all my Forgotten Realms books in a housefire and I am sure there was an entry for them in a module.
I introduced them in The Haunted Halls of Eveningstar module (along with the Lock Lurker).

Hello Ed. My son and his friends adventuring party are currently up to various hijinx in the Sea of Fallen Stars, with a lot of time in Bay of Chessentia. They are convinced it must be based on the Chesepeake Bay, and asked if I would ask you.
No, I avoided all direct real-world analogues when creating the Realms, and when I made up Chessenta, bay and all, I was six and hadn't traveled anywhere into the USA except Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan. ;} Chesapeake Bay is beautiful, though!

Wow, thatis a good question. . there’s a lot of feuding, and ascension is tied in part to belief. . but randomness? Now I’m really thinking about this
I wonder if [@] has thought about this or has an answer?
Oh, yes.
First: the game posits fallible gods (flawed, make mistakes, can't foresee, are not all-knowing). Otherwise, PCs can't be heroes, just pawns following a script (and, having no agency, lack moral responsibility, too). So the best way to view D&D gods is  that they are akin to the Greek and Roman gods: superpowered humans, who behave like humans (lying, cheating, childish tantrums, etc. as well as noble and kind acts).
We have some maniacally power-hungry gods (the Dead Three), we have insane gods (Cyric), and we have  selflessly generous deities (Eilistraee). We have gods who didn't want godhood (Finder) and we have gods who, yes, achieved godhood randomly (Moander). And yes, godhood or the thought of achieving it (Karsus) does funny things to the minds of mortals. We even have fusion  deities (Angharradh). The idea is to provide a full array of divine minds and characters, not just alignments and portfolios, so there will be constant drama = maximum adventure opportunities.
Thanks so much for answering the question of two Catholic theologians muddling through the Realms!
My pleasure!
The Realms is a giant step sideways from real-world religions in that no one has to root their belief in "faith," as they see avatars and manifestations of the deities often enough that they KNOW.
And "believe in" all the gods.
All the moral battles, however, remain.

Hi Ed! I'm having a friend do a commission piece of art for me. It will be a scene from Swords of Dragonfire. I hope he can capture Florin Falconhand and Alura Durshavin fighting Baerem the Dread Doorwarden. Any tips or things to be highlighted before he starts?thanks
Sure.
Pennae: looks like a scruffier Shadowheart from BG3 (hair, eyes), all clad in well-worn, dusty-gray-faded (from original black-dyed) dark leathers, black metal throat gorget, thigh-high soft-soled boots, many daggers sheathed all over.
Florin: Unlike SPELLFIRE cover, is not a ginger, or bearded. Tousled hair, jaw and nose as in the attached photo. Always looks calm and unruffled, “in charge of himself” in any situation. A man you instinctively trust.

It's not strange at all to look to the Realms.
The clergy of Eldath are caregivers of the land, and the priests of Ilmater are "turn the other cheek, take the punishment" (with a few paladin exceptions). I'm out the door to my day job right now, but will provide others tonight.

Please expand on this. I love the Dragonborn as Erin has written them, but I feel like this kinda steals some of their valor and makes them less special. "A dragon god did it" isn't quite like a race being made to be servants & rockin' out against their oppressors (w/out gods).
Not trying to be flippant, btw, we've chatted before and I'm a huge FR lore nerd. I'm just going a little crazy bc this tweet does a lot of heavy lifting on the wikia/fandom and casts question marks over aberian dragonborn's self-authority and self-determinism
Ed. Please
I'll get to this in four hours or so. Have just come from the day job to help someone to medical help, then have a library board meeting.
But I'll get there!!
Okay, the medical thing took an astonishingly short time, so I JUST have time to squeeze in a lore reply before the meeting 
Here we go!
The relationship between the dragonborn race native to Abeir and the Dragonborn of Bahamut is this: Bahamut used the  dragonborn of Abeir as his models for “his” dragonborn, studying willing members of the race closely to learn their body structure and what powers he could infuse them with, so as to transform the non-draconic volunteers to become “his” dragonborn  (emissaries of Bahamut to mortals).
The few “very old dragons” who know about this are servants of Bahamut who served as steeds to carry the handful of willing Abeiran dragonborn individuals to Bahamut for his study, and back again. (BTW, I’ve just covered 
Abeir itself in my Realmslore videos.)
None of this changes or diminishes the deeds and history of the dragonborn of Abeir (such as their rebellion).
I was trying to remain as vague as possible about this to preserve maximum author/designer freedom, but  it’s in my lore notes that an ever-wider circle of creatives have seen, so I’m happy to set you at ease.

[@] I was wondering, in TFR what would happen if a God taking a mortal form would get somehow infected with an Illithid tadpole ? 
Nothing ? some horrific new Illithid God ? anything else ?
It's highly unlikely, with an established God, that the tadpole could establish control over the divine brain. So, nothing: the deity would shatter the sentience of the illithid and subsume it.
However, with an insane god like Cyric, a new illithid god COULD arise.

Quick lore query, [@] Since most Primordials (apart from Kossuth) are said to be indifferent to their human faithful, are faithful of these Primordials sent to their 'gods' Planes in the afterlife similar to petitioners of true Deities? Or just forgotten? Many thanks!
In the rare event that a mortal devoted themselves to a primordial above all other deities, they would go to the plane of that primordial (note that some primordials are on/in Toril itself). And yes, likely become elementals (retaining their memories of their  mortal lives).
Otherwise, they go to the plane of the deity they most actively venerated in life (remember, every sane sentient being in the Realms “believes in” all of the gods).

[@] Hey Ed! I'm running Dungeon of the Mad Mage & I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to portray Halaster when the time comes. I was wondering if you could share a few roleplay tips or personality traits of his pre or post madness? Thanks for all you do!
Hi!
Pre-madness, Halaster was a calm, patient listener and “gentle lecturer,” except when fools took such traits as signs of weakness—whereupon he became a cold rock of fearless obstinancy, his eyes as hard as two stones and his tone grim.
Mad” Halaster glares silently more than he speaks, and when he does speak, is emphatic and not-quite-sneering and speaks in clipped phrases. He comes and goes in silence, often “fading out of thin air” and departing in a blink (there one moment, not there the next).

Hi there mister Greenwood! I call upon your knowledge because I'd like to do a "level 0" campaign with PCs which are just common folks without any innate gift that are kinda forced into adventures and shenanigans, and I have encountered a problem with spellcasters 1/2
According to you, all spellcasters need a very rare "Gift" to be able to cast even the most basic cantrip, but since the campaign is focused on just regular, ungifted people, I don't know how to justify the players playing spellcasters of any kind.
Many "regular" folks have hidden "wild talents" for magic; their Gift gets revealed when they contact magic (touch an item, get hit by a spell, step into a ward, etc.)
Others can't cast spells, but can "twist" and aim powers unleashed by items into what they want.

Hello, [@] If I may ask (for accuracy purposes for a campaign), do you know if Vandria (elven goddess of grief) is worshiped in the Realms? Thank you in advance, you're awesome!
Yes, she is. Not by many, for her most devout worshippers in the Realms are those driven by grief (i.e. a drive to avenge a lost loved one, or kin, dominates their lives). One such is Rauvor Mreldryn, whose entire town was wiped out; he's hunting down every attacker.

Hi Ed! A question: I had a character who's backstory is that she ran away with a young red wizard from Calimshan and at the closing of her adventures (campaign end) she married said red wizard. How would the red wizards react to an adult sorcerer moving to Thay if hubby is a RW?
Clarification: She was born a noble in Memnon. Her dad was an archmage pasha there (nasty Cyric worshipper) & RWs were at trade war with him, trying to move to Memnon and he kept killing RW agents. She sided with an RW against her abusive dad out of spite & help young RW survive.
The Probity Corps (for "grunt" tailing in the streets) and senior Red Wizards would keep a close watch over her. Always.
They'd be watching for any signs she's an agent of a foreign power or "outcast" Red Wizards living outside the realm.
Wow, thanks! I was thinking they would kill her, force her under their umbrella in a way, rob her of her powers or something of the sort.
Like everyone else, the Red Wizards are looking for assets (allies or dupes they can use), so if she isn't working against them, perhaps she can be manipulated into working for them, and if she grows in power, she can be a REAL asset. So they'll wait and see 
I am using the Probity corps at moment in my homebrew game. One of the agents is forcing the PC's to do what he wants so he doesn't imprison them for the death of a Red Wizard he really amenable and almost kind, it's freaks them out so much haha
A WONDERFUL way to play a Probity Corps agent (and I should mention that the Corps are the creation of Alex Kammer, the man behind Gamehole Con and a mega-adventure you SHOULD NOT MISS called "The End of Everything." Who is also really amenable and truly kind.)

Related question: do Giftless scholars of the arcane exist in Faerun? And can they achieve anything besides being the assistant/servant of a proper wizard?
There are many, including some of the Avowed (monks) of Candlekeep, and many clergy of Deneir and Oghma. They are the best cataloguers and recordkeepers of magical diaries and workbooks (notes on “how I crafted this spell, or modified it into a new variant”) that wizards write. Some mages use such folk as their personal librarians, to kee[p backup copies of spells and magical notes “offsite” and so (relatively) safe.

Forgotten Realms fans: Are you interested in [@] personal Forgotten Realms campaign?: https://thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?t=32789
We've all seen the officially published TSR/WotC content for Forgotten Realms in one form or another. But, beyond snippets from either the Elminster's Realms book from over a decade ago, some Dragon articles, Candlekeep Q&As and some YouTube videos, I'm not sure how much of Ed's original version is out there? Is there something in his grandfathered contract that prevented him from saying too much? Or some other reason why even notes haven't been widespread? On the other side of the topic, has he posted about this elsewhere at some point? I'm curious about anything Ed's Realms that can be shareable.
Doc Necrotic wants to know if anyone has listed or compiled the things Ed's campaign has done.
How much do you know about?
My home campaign has been going since 1978, and is dominated by subplots, PC sideline activities and diplomacy and investments (not combats or dungeon crawls). The full extent has never been compiled, and likely never will be. It would fill 70+ full-length novels.

Thank you! It's specifically the term 'Underdark' I'm intrigued by. I think Gygax referred to Underoerth and early Monster Manuals used 'underground'; for some reason I have it in my head that UnderDARK is #Realmslore.
Please check D1 - D3, for the original Underdark trilogy in #greyhawk #DnD. D3, Vault of the Drow, is really a setting based adventure for Dark Elves in the Greyhawk setting. Plus I have done talk shows with [@] on this subject.
Knew one if you would have the answer. I did think it was referred to as the Underdark in those modules but thought it better to get confirmation from direct sources.
Can confirm.
The Underdark" appears in games set in Greyhawk before the Realms was an official D&D setting. (The Realms was first published before D&D , as a fiction setting, but I called the subterranean settings "the underways" or more formally "the World Below

Great master [@] , I have a curiosity that I hope Oghma will allow me to resolve with her Wisdom.
There are Halruaa trade conclaves in other cities. Are there commercial portals between any cities? +Example: wouldn't a permanent portal between Halruaa and Waterdeep make sense? Or, a portal from Thay to Waterdeep (you had informed me about Thay's embassy in Waterdeep). +These are just questions from a fan who has been reading Forgotten Realms since 1992. Big hug and happy new year.
Not since the Spellplague. They twisted the minds and bodies of all using them, and ruined trade goods/items, too. (There are older, pre-existing portals scattered all over the Realms.)
I realize that EVERYTHING has returned as it was in 1356 DR And, I love it all 
Shhh, don't tell anyone. It'll be our secret
