Hi, Mr Greenwood, I have a question, my fiancee and I have been discussing this for quite some time about a half dragon character we have, do dragons have any specific smell? Or do they smell like where they live ie a red dragon smelling like sulfur because they live in a volcano
Different dragon types have different smells, that intensify when a dragon is angry or has other strong emotions right now, is horny, or is unwashed, and also increase with age and size. Blue dragons smell like ozone, copper like heated copper green dragons like red wine vinegar, black dragons like iodine, and so on.
The scent is innate; where they live (e.g. stinking swamp waters, mud, volcanic ash) adds smells atop their innate smell, mingling with it.

Hello Mr. Greenwood! I have a question. One of my players wants to literally remove ALL evil from the universe. He’s pretty confident that he can pull it off. Besides the forces of evil is there anything else preventing him from doing this?
Yes, unfortunately.
Time (as in, his limited lifespan: there's a LOT of evil to "remove").
Method: he must be very careful about how he removes evil, lest he become evil himself during the process.
Judgement: one person's "evil" may not be the same as another's. Ethical code?

Spelljammer fans: Has anyone ever done anything with [@] "dead world of Ambereye"?: https://thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?t=35099
Big Mac is trying to figure out how to extrapolate the crystal sphere out in a Greenwoodian way.
What do you think Ed was thinking?
I often wonder what Ed was thinking, myself. ;}
However, in this case, I can impart this much: there’s a crystal sphere now called Hulthoonar by its inhabitants. At its heart is a darker-than-flame-orange star called “Ambereye,” and its solar system had two earth-like  planets: one named Ambereye after the home star, and another named Hulthoon. They were home to rival civilizations of sentient, human-like upright bipeds that made war on each other, using magic. After a long struggle (actually, a series of skirmishes with rebuilding and  magic-experimentation time between them), the Amberites lost and their world was devastated; it’s now “dead,” in an eternal twilight of particle-laded dust clouds that block sunlight, so nothing grows. Hulthoon was much humbled in the strife and has reverted to  medieval-era “small warring baronies with much mistrust of magic and those who wield it.” The hidden stronghold of Thurdle is on Hulthoon’s wilder, monster-roamed continent. So are many dragons, but the monster hunters never hunt so close to home, and park their ship  away from Hulthoon to avoid being detected by those who still command magic enough to scry afar and reach out with destructive power. Instead, they hunt on the three moons of Hulthoon, very large satellites (as moons go) that are home to roaming herds of cloven-hoofed  beasts, and the dragons who prey at will on them—and not inhabited by Hulthoonar.
The Thurdle Mages were Hulthoonar themselves, but fled their world to avoid constant persecution by magic-fearing, mage-hating fellow Hulthoonar. They are warily building their personal  magical power over time, ere they risk voyaging out of their sphere to hunt more widely, though some of them dream of richer hunting grounds and greater magely power.
So there you have it. More that hit the cutting-room floor (before I made turnover; LOST SHIPS was  written VERY quickly to launch the series of accessories, so there was no time to give the in-house editors extra work: I wrote, Jeff did initial concept/game design edit, and we hurled it into the hopper).
So there you have it! Expand away!!!

Hi, Mr Greenwood, just wanted to ask, is there a mason's guild in Baldur's Gate ? And if so, in which district would it be located ? Asking for a character with the Guild Artisan background.
Yes. The Guild of Masons, Stonecutters, and Hard-Sculptors (“Stoneheads” in Baldurian street slang) is now newly headquartered on the northwestern edge of Stonyeyes district in the Outer City, and “runs” of dressed building stone from its sorting yards (the  space needs of which have forced this guild to move several times, abandoning their initial location in Lower City’s Brampton district for progressively “distant” locations) run along Wall Lane between the Guildyard Gates and the city’s Basilisk Gate.

Hello [@] i would like to create a campaign with a crinti battle sorcerer/rogue/spellwarp sniper, but i have a doubt : could a male crinti could officially be a sorcerer, or all form of magic is prohibed for males in Dambrath ? Thank you ! #Realmslore
A male crinti could indeed be a sorcerer. The prohibition is on TRAINING males in arcane spellcraft, so those who wield magic without that sort of training get around it and are tolerated in the society. Watched, but tolerated.

[@] i am very curious if you have answered this in a video or plan to in the future, or even on here; what is the cutlure of magic in the forgotten realms, more specifically how do the mages of various types view each other?
This question comes up often, but my answer is usually a variation of the same thing: attitudes vary widely by individual and from time to time and place to place. If you live near a major temple, the “line” preached by local clerics affects you (pro or con) and if you’re in Cormyr, and the War Wizards are part of state enforcement, you may love law and order (their protection) or detest it. If local wizards protect you often against dragon or wyvern raids, you prize them. .but what if a rumour arises that they 
ARE the raiding dragons or wyverns (transforming themselves)? And so on
It’s important to remember two things: communications is slower and much patchier in the Realms than in our modern world, so “widely shared” attitudes can’t be changed quickly and are  often influenced by gossip, and “everybody knows” magic is everywhere, like sunrises and sunsets and stars, not something that one can easily choose to shun or work against; you grow up with it, just like you grow up eating and breathing.

If you mean the Dragonmere, it is an arm of the sea, a "long bay" or arm of the Sea of Fallen Stars/Inner Sea. "Lake of Dragons" is the most popular name for it, but is fanciful, originating in a bard's ballad about dragons.

The published version of the Undermountain megadungeon did not use Ed Greenwood's original maps. Were these ever shared or published anywhere (whether in whole or in part)? If not, would it be possible to publish these at some point?
See all the orange areas, and the blue (flooded) passage? All part of my original map. What happened was that TSR didn't have time to redraw my original faint pencil maps (with my tiny handwriting all over them), so Dave Sutherland donated some of his  gigantic rooms Empire of the Petal Throne campaign maps, and stuck them in all around the edges. Yes, the other nine levels of "my original" Undermountain never got published, but I submitted them so TSR owns them, so I can't publish them elsewhere now.
I can't believe they sold this friggin empty dungeon. It still makes me mad.
Yep. My original was completely detailed. Every room, every passage, all the connections with the sewers and with the surface city. All the cabals and gangs using "their little bit" of Undermountain, and dreading intruders "from below."

Certainly. The classic humanoid lich would be more prone to that sort of personality, but both sorts of liches could greet the world as Vincent Price's frequent on-screen persona did. Neither of them would likely have his foodie side, though. :}

[@] Hey there, Ed. My group is currently in the Plains of Purple Dust, and have lots of questions about the purple dust itself. Mostly, we are wondering: Where does this purple dust come from?
Like most deserts, the dust is simply the grit (tiny particles of rock) that are so light, among the sand of that dessicated area, that they blow around in even the faintest breezes. I’ll be doing a YouTube video a few months from now about why the dust of  this particular desert is purple (and turns the sky crimson where it isn’t amethyst, due to hanging in the air as sunlight beats down). Hint: if you can detect magic, the dust radiates magic. Meaning some magical event or discharge of some great power, long  ago, made the dust purple (and likely created the desert).
For now, let's just say the Realms has a very magical past. In this case involving conflict, liches, and dragons 
Is this event related to either the Imaskari or the Mulan people when they reigned over there? Or maybe even further back in time with the Batrachi?
A long time ago. ;}
So not purple worm dandruff then?
Not. ;}

Hey [@] the revival of Tyr in the Second Sundering, Torm seems like he "disappeared." As an avid Champion of Torm lover, is Torm still around in FR, and do his followers still follow the Penance of century past?
Torm is very much “still around” in the Realms circa 1500 DR, his church small but energetic and very much a “factor on the local scene” in most places on Faerûn. His devout followers still perform the Penance of Duty; doing so shapes and guides their lives.

[@] Hello from France,
I'm an old DM and a great fan of Forgotten Realms.
Currently I'm running a campaign near Tuern and particularly Uttersea. I wasn't able to find a map of that small town.
Do you have any advise for its design please.
Sure!
Originally, the volcanic island was known as Uttersea, as to seafaring Northmen it marked the beginning of vast open seas, uncharted and “empty of all but storms.” The rich volcanic soil, coupled with the volcanic heat that still warms the half-collapsed #realmslore caldera and the bay that now fills its missing southern arc, made it great for farming, so the Northmen seized it and settled. The land became known as Tuern after an early leader, and the settlement known as Uttersea. It was settled haphazardly, but frequent  landslides forced a design on it that persists today: stone wharves jut out into the bay and are joined together along the shore into a hard “dock” with two large “beaching ramps” where ships large and small can be winched ashore; upland of both ramps are large  shipbuilding sheds.
Above them, Uttersea climbs the slopes of the caldera, which are thickly planted with clinging vines and stunted shrubs and trees to anchor the “clinker” stone-rubble-dominated soil as much as possible.
Streets follow a switchback pattern: : from the ends of the dock, packed-clinker roads curve along the caldera parallel to the dock, like rice-growing terraces on slopes in parts of the real-world Far East, with NO direct uphill/downhill routes, just the curves at both ends of the parallel runs.
The best houses are located as high as possible, off to the sides of the main “bands” of streets on their own side-lanes.

Hey Ed, I had a question I couldn't find an answer to. I've been trying to understand the timeline of the changes to FR cosmology, but and a few things struck me as odd. I was thinking about the implications of the switches between the Great Wheel and the World Tree mostly  such as, first and foremost, why and how did the cosmology switch, both in-world and out-of-game? It seems as though the outer planes were in a sort of WIP state behind the curtain, which nobody could access during the Era of Upheaval. What happened to the planes that got cut?
I'm also curious to know what the design intention was for this change and if you had any inside knowledge on how/why this was needed from an IRL executive standpoint, and what involvement you might've had on designing the World Tree/Axis models, if any. Appreciate you
I don't know why the cosmology was changed; I've never been on staff at either TSR or Wizards, and that was an internal design decision. I can only speculate. One thing I have heard is that it covered for "getting rid of" problematic plane names like "Happy Hunting Grounds."

Could you clarify this for us?
Yes. The D&D in-house design thinking has always been that NATURAL iron or copper in the earth is no hindrance to druidic magic, but REFINED, concentrated metal items ("cold iron") is. When the Realms was made a D&D setting, that became canon for the Realms.

[@] Hello from Minnesota, this past weekend my party and I were investigating sightings of red clothed wizards about a days ride from Waterdeep when we thought of a question. What does being healed by magic feel like? We came to the conclusion that (1/2) having your bones rapidly mended, muscle stitched, and flesh healed would probably hurt like a bitch and then be hot and itchy afterwards whether by potion or spell. Just curious if that’s a correct assumption or not
Thank you for your time and have a good day. (2/2)
The answer is: it varies depending on what sort of being is healing, what damage is being healed, and what magic is being used.
It's always "a rush," meaning: an excited, tingling, energy rushing through you sensation.
What varies is how painful it is, and if you feel hot, cold, or otherwise. "New" (replaced) bits of you often itch for a day or three afterwards, yes. Lower-level spells shield the recipient less against pain and shock; more powerful spells are "gentler."
There are instances in Realmsplay at the "home"  table where individuals being healed in battle, while active, by touch spells, roared out in agony as they were being healed.

Speaking from ignorance here. If Ed created the FR and what we see on the actual game differs from time to time, they can just make the changes? :o
When TSR purchased the Realms in 1986, they acquired the right to make changes, add things, and take things away. What I say and write about the Realms is canon, unless or until they contradict or change it, in print. So, yes, they can just make the changes. ;}

[@] question for you, if i may! Big fan of Forgotten Realms and im currently running a campaign set in the Silver Marches, are there any tidbits you could share about maybe a city or area in the region that isn't in a published work or similar? Thanks! #Realmslore
Sure! Over at my Discord server, Greenwood’s Grotto, I answer Realmslore queries as often as I can grab the time.
From a reply I just made there, here’s an establishment in the city of Sundabar that welcomes adventurers of all races, from drow to aarakocra, and  lizardfolk to dragonborn:
Brokh’s Tankard. In the hovels and older warehouses that crowd the eastern verges of Sundabar is this adventurers’ favorite, a low dive of a tavern that consists of a dank, gloomy stone-walled taproom of many alcoves and candle-wheel  lamps hanging from massive chains. This great room has kitchens and pantries behind it to the left, jakes behind it to the right, and in between passages that descend in long, curving ramps, to connect to a descending series of cellars, also given over to  tables for dining and drinking. The seventh and eighth cellars have side-tunnels leading to rooms that can be rented for the night, for travelers desiring accommodations or drunkards too gone to find their ways home, and the ninth and lowest cellar is where  the kegs of merriment are stored.
The founding dwarf, “Brokh” (more formally, Barrokhuld the Younger, of Clan Vorstone), is long dead, but his descendants still own and run the place. With the aid of some living spells who inhabit the cellars (guarding the  strong drink in the ninth level, by the way) and about whom locals tell all manner of conflicting and colorful origin stories.
In Sundabar, Brokh’s Tankard is best known for the Burning of the Beards, a battle that almost destroyed the tavern, and began with  a 1362 DR duergar raid on some shield dwarves drinking at the Tankard, whom the two-dozen-strong duergar regarded as trade rivals hampering their prosperity in “their” region of the Underdark.
Ironically, they were entirely entirely mistaken, attacking the  wrong dwarves, and paid for this error with their lives, though they took over a dozen dwarves, and about twenty other drinkers, with them. They began their attack with fire magic directed at the beards of their targets, and the taproom was a scorched shell by the time the last duergar was overwhelmed and hacked down—with three clerics and a mage battling the flames to quench them and save that end of Sundabar from a widespread inferno. To this day, torches, lanterns, and fire spells are still forbidden for guests  of the tavern to bring or wield.
And there you have it: a meeting and hiring place for adventurers, a "base" if you'd like. I have literally hundreds of small lore tidbits about the Sword Coast North; is there anything SORT of lore that would be particularly helpful?

Hey [@]
A while back, I asked a question about mapping Ostoria before it fell. Trying to pin point the locations (so I've found Nedeheim and Helligheim), and seeing how much territory it had before the fell. You think you could help a Giant Fan out?
I have done very little with Ostoria, and would have to lean on my "Lore Lords" of the Realms, like Eric L Boyd and George Krashos, but in general: giants ranged far and wide over the lands in their day, with their own "hunting grounds" (includes foraging) venturing far from Ostoria, which was more a tucked-away, mountain-girt refuge that giants visited when they felt the need, rather than "the country in which all giants dwelt."
So, not a huge territory. Let me rummage in the lorefiles and get back to you.

My characters will have to stop on by one day and have a drink or two.
My Tankard lore is part of a lore reply on "Unsafe Havens:" taverns, inns, and other gathering places that welcome or tolerate "very different from the norm" adventurers.
A few months from now, look for a Realmslore video (on my Patreon or YouTube) exploring half a dozen of them.

What's the most significant thing they "just changed" from the original?
Putting real-world cultures (or Hollywood versions of them) into the Realms.
Then replacing my Moonshaes with the TSR UK Albion setting.
Then changing the gods and deleting assassins for a D&D game edition change (Time of Troubles).
Then the 100-year time jump of 4th edition.
Oh huh.
I always thought the "Human cultures migrating from Earth to Faerun via magic" was an original element from you. Did not know that was TSR.
I had gates linking many parallel Prime Material Planes (our real Earth and the Realms among them) but secretive traders and fugitives used them, not invading armies bringing entire cultures with them.
What about melting a glacier to add the bloodstone lands?
That, too! ;}
Are they going to do anything more with Alu-Fiends? Asking for reasons.
I don't know.
I've never been on staff at either TSR or Wizards, and so wouldn't know content details until I bought a release at my gaming store. If I was involved in writing/designing something, NDAs would prevent me saying anything pre-release. Sorry!

I got a Drow male, minor noble house from Maerimydra who did some stuff that had him running from the city (lucky for him Kurgoths Sack went down right after and his family had bigger, hotter problems). What food might such a Drow probably find himself liking on the surface?
Drow are as varied in their culinary tastes as, say, humans, but MOST drow from the Underdark will fall in love with fresh fruit of all sorts (and degrees of sweetness/tartness) thanks to the juicyness and flavors.
Nicely-seasoned and prepared snake, eel, and  edible beetle innards (and shrimp, crab, and lobster for the same consistencies) are closer to the non-fungi edibles drow like in the Underdark, so will be more “familiar” to him, and so feel “safer” and substantial as meals.
And finally, the variety of edible surface fleshy mushrooms and fungi will seem to him as if he went from “three varieties of meat at local shops” to “a huge buffet of all sorts of meat” for him to sample.
Everything else will be an acquired taste, but green vegetables (peas, lettuce, celery cucumbers) will be the most exotic, and will either revolt him forever, or be “dicey” at first but then become his sought-afters. Spices and herbs of the surface will be a constant learning curve, and sweet confections (sugar-coated breadstuffs!) may be a  shock, or a delight! (Happy roleplaying!)

[@] in Hand of Fire, one "Weave-wraith" dies; in web article, Alustriel bound the others. https://web.archive.org/web/20050212042733/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/fr/handoffire
She planned on a long-term spellfire-based cage; what befell them with Shandril out? Are they related to Barrowfields item-bound ones? Why'd Mystra save them?
With the tumult of those times in the Realms at which HAND OF FIRE was set behind Toril now, the need to humble the mad Netherese Weave-wraiths has passed. Alustriel’s plan was for her to cage them with the Weave and her command of it, while Shandril’s spellfire  burned away some of their magical power and some of their madness with it.
As a Weavemaster, Alustriel can command the Weave with enough force and precision to call on it to cage wraiths or other powerful beings (living spells, for example) with a strong  magical nature. Her warning to Andras was for him to summon other Weavemasters (Elminster, her fellow Sisters, or other Chosen) in the event she herself went down, to re-encage the mad Netherese.
Mystra forbade their destruction because, despite their madness  pride, and fell intent, she wanted their magical knowledge and creativity (devising new spells) to be preserved. .because that’s the core of what Mystra seeks to do: make magic more widely used by everyone, and constantly make magic wider in its horizons (creative uses).

Does it make sense to allow the Zhents their own language, 'Zhentish'?
Local dialect (slang), certainly. However, so many Zhents have come from elsewhere, and speak Common along the trade routes and around the Moonsea, that they're mainly going to talk like Heartlands merchants everywhere.

No. What I've done down the years is think about who would have settled/predominated in a spot, what in-Realms language they speak, and what dipthongs and dominant vowel sounds and constructions are in this tongues. That in mind, I just make place names up.

It's still weird they didn't use Ed Greenwood's actual Undermountain. His maps were too squiggly, so they threw them out, substituted the artist's old home dungeon from an Empire of the Petal Throne campaign, and called it a day.
Wait, so does this mean no one has seen Greenwood's actual Undermountain or did I misunderstand?
TSR owns my uppermost level of Undermountain maps, and has seen (and received photocopies of) them, back in 1986, plus an upper level inside Mount Waterdeep. They also received and own the Blue Alley, the Dungeon of the Crypt, and several other "mini-dungeons"  inside Waterdeep.
If you examine the "Level 1" published maps of Undermountain, all of the central rectangle (the orange rooms and passages, and the yellow ones linking them) are my original layout, minus some inside-pillar shafts and stairs that connected  to the surface (cellars, inside building walls, and trapdoors in back alleys, in Waterdeep) and to dungeon levels below. Some of my original Level 2 layout (around the river and Skullport) made it into print, too.

Master, a newborn heir must rise fast—darkness looms! I've scourged Chronomancy, but couldn't find anything to hasten his growth. Does such magic exist? (If not, perhaps Elminster knows? 😊) Thank you for the Realms!
Chronomancy is chasing a dream made of wisps of light and mist: it's far more ideas and concepts than dependable magic. Reliably, all one could do is send the heir ahead in time, to arrive in a future year just as he is now (so, with no more experience or  physical maturation). There's no substitute or workaround for real-world lived experience. Spells can make someone larger and stronger, but don't teach mastery of the new might and frame. Only a life filled with variety of adventure does that. Sorry.
How about sending them to another plane or sphere? Are there any where time flows faster or slower than Toril?
Yes, BUT no one's ever charted the differences in time flows, and they seem to change, sometimes suddenly and greatly, like water disturbed by big solid things plunging into the flows.

AD&D Terrors Unleashed
The AD&D Dracolich doesn't just breathe death-it savors your fear. Undead dragon with a soul gem that laughs at your vorpal blade.
One icy blast, and your party's frozen; one bad save, and its fear aura breaks your will. 5E might give you a shot, but AD&D snarls, "Face its skull, and you're already ash."
Enter its hoard, and you're already doomed
Clyde told me he spent two straight days painting the treasure everyone's wading around in.
Elminster looks quite surprised for a well experienced adventurer.
He's surprised Shandril's being such a reckless idiot, unleashing at the dracolich without going for the head.

How would the Zhentarim react to an agent of theirs going rogue, splitting from the main bidy and using their cell to take over, lets say the ten-towns?
Badly. "Freelancing" is usually rewarded by death, within the Brotherhood--unless the results are such an advance that leadership is surprised and delighted. Even then, the "reward" is usually to be sent on missions far, far away.

It has happened already: Qilué of the Seven Sisters is shared by Mystra and Eilistraee. It is VERY rare, as deities tend to mistrust each other so deeply. Allied deities quietly assisting each other's Chosen (e.g. among the Triad) isn't rare.

Got a blue dragon crisis rn. When half-dragons are made with mammalian humanoids, is it a live-birth, shelled eggs, or does it depend on the mother?
If the mammalian humanoid is the mother, and the birth is successful, the half-dragon emerges as a nine-pound-or-so curled-up miniature half-dragon in a caul that typically ruptures as it comes out, amid a wash of fluid, the caul being very like a soft, thin rubbery egg around the baby.

Hi [@] Two questions from a fresh watch of the D&D movie:
What’re the mechanics behind a Red Wizard Blade blocking out clerical magic? Is it the whole weave?
Were any prominent Waterdhavian nobles caught up in the Beckoning Death?
Cheers as always!
SOME Red Wizard blades have enchantments powerful enough to deflect/bend the Weave in a small space around them; this can cause certain spells that aren't touch magics to "miss." There are spells to mitigate/lessen this.
No "important" nobles; the affected were idle wastrels, mainly third sons and sidelined "uncles" whose leisure time was devoted to drinking and gambling.
Heads of houses were leery of visiting and investing in Neverwinter well before Dagult Neverember "fell ill."

As of 1500 DR, in the Realms, it's now common usage to address someone as "gentle" (and a group as "gentles") regardless of station in society or gender. This is how most innkeepers and tavernmasters would greet strangers.
There's also an increasing use of "saer" in the same way (used regardless of gender or apparent gender, and station in society).
Followup, sorry! How would Saer be pronounced? Is it sigh-air or say-er or sahr?

Hi mr. Greenwood
I'm thinking about adding Calimar Arkhenneld as NPC and maybe future quest giver in the Elminster Tower in Shadowdale. I'm wondering what would be he doing there and can a lich even eat and drink wine etc. when he rests from the Underdark stuff?
Calimar would be in Elminster’s Tower on Mystra’s business: the goddess told him to work with Elminster on an endeavour, likely spreading “old” spellbooks and scrolls among the drow as “use more magic” seeds—so he’d be crafting such “fake old” items.
Liches can eat and drink normally, though they derive no sustenance thereby (and if the lich is sufficiently decayed, everything just “falls through,” so polite liches arrange a catch-bucket).

If you're already really rich, a knighthood AND land grant (waving the chance at a future baronial title), and if already noble, an office (such as Warden of the Ports, or Warden of Tunland).

Do you usually role-play your time "at home"? Yes. Building strongholds (interacting with tradesmen, quarry suppliers, etc.)? Yes. My "home" players want to immerse themselves in the Realms; they have sideline jobs, investments, friendships and business relationships they work on, and so on.

In AD&D, would you allow a wizard to teleport onto a ship that he owns without knowing its current location?
Yes, the teleport can be done. Here's the trick: a chalked area on a deck, or a rug in a cabin, or a kept-clear closet is the "known familiar destination" for the jaunt.
This is OFFICIAL.
How so?
Well, this was the result of a long philosophical argument over beer: Gary Gygax, Len Lakofka, Jim Ward, and me.
Back and forth the points flew, amid much discussion , but in the end, Gary agreed with this interpretation. With a warning: DMs MUST police  with barriers to teleportation, or "the abuse will be MASSIVE." (His words.)

Can any Forgotten Realms fans familiar with 2E and Elminster's Ecologies tell me if any of them actually cover the northern Moonsea area that I circled? Thar to the East and Cormanthor to the South each have their own books. What does this area fall under? [@] need to look at Mike Schley's superb map of that area. It's the definitive reference. [@] Any chance you can point me in the direction of which map Ed is talking about? I see you have a 4E one with the Moonsea but its mostly Thar, Vassa, Damara, and up to the Great Glacier.

I have a question, if a modern doctor got to the realms and was making penicillin for his own uses, what would the value of it be, like, an ounce of it? I have no clue on how to price something like that
It would vary quite a bit depending on what local buyers know of its efficacy (remember, it's a mold or a distillate of mold, so they're predisposed to think "bad"), but for those who value it: 8-16 gp/vial, 12 gp average.

Hey Ed, what cocktail would best represent Baldur's Gate? My players are way too curious and I had no idea what to tell them, lmao
Real-world or in-Realms?
Both of them, so I can make the mixture for them again at the next session.
For Baldur’s Gate, I would go with a whiskey sour (with egg white; insert obligatory “raw egg” health warning here).
Made NOT with bourbon, but with a less -sweet scotch whiskey like Highland Park 12 or Ardbeg 10.
Ingredients ounces whiskey drops (no more!) Amaretto ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed ounce simple syrup ounce egg white (optional)
Garnish: Angostura bitters
Steps
Combine whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white (if using), in a shaker, and dry-shake for half a minute, without ice.
Add ice, shake again for a fast-count of ten.
Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice. Garnish with 3–4 drops of Angostura bitters, then add the 2 drops of Amaretto.
In the Realms, such a drink is known as a Mermaid’s Tail (a mermaid’s kiss is sweet, but the tail-slap of her rejection is sour).

The Forgotten Realms were purchased from Ed Greenwood for $5,000
Weirdly, that low sale price probably means he'll go down in history as a legend of transmedia fantasy production, whereas if he'd asked a lot more nobody would likely know who he is. Strange conundrum.
Man at the time I wonder if he could have asked for more. It probably seemed like a lot
It was a pure passion project for the guy. It's like being a garage band and you're offered to open for some big name band and being offered some small sum You're probably not going to refuse unless they pay you more money - you're just happy to get the big audience and recognition.
Ed did the type of creative work that almost never gets recognized despite its depth, scope, and quality - but for every Ed who does get recognized, there are probably dozens who don't Heck, how many long-term homebrew campaigns could be fantasy settings fit to make movies, comics, video games, and write novels in - but nobody will ever hear of them? Probably quite a few.
Glad Ed got recognized in any case It's a win for the passion project going big - even if they payday wasn't huge!
That's it exactly. Mike Dobson later told me I could have asked for a LOT more but I didn't care: I just wanted TSR to say "yes" so I could get colour maps of the Realms that didn't have my pencil crayon strokes visibly in all the seas.

Maro [@] Hey Ed! I've got a question for you. I really like Kelemvor, as a character and as a god. He and Jergal are by far my favorite DnD gods. I always wondered, does the souls of every being in the multiverse pass the divine judgment of Kelemvor?
And, does the soul of an elf go through Kelemvor's divine judgment before being reborn as a new elf? :42 PM · May 11, 2025
No. Kelemvor judges the souls of humans and sentient beings whose souls aren’t consumed (by hags or beings hags sell souls to, for instance) or claimed for judgment by other deities (such as goblin or kobold deities judging the souls of goblins or kobolds respectively). Elves are among those mortals that Kelemvor would normally not judge, though almost all half-elves do experience his judgment.
And Maro, sorry it took so long to get back to you. I'm falling farther and farther behind, as the lore queries rush in!
Plus tard il sera trop tard. Notre vie c'est maintenant. Sigh.

Woah! 
Are you saying that being eaten by a hag means the SOUL is eaten too?! Permanent, forever death with no afterlife?
What other perils in the world of Faerûn carries this same level of danger? Becoming a vampire or lich, etc?
Ah! Here's the thing: if a hag steals a soul in her soul bag, the body it belongs to can't be resurrected. It CAN be animated. If the soul is consumed by a hag or a being the hag sells/barters the soul to, it, er, passes out the other end diminished. So the soul  survives, but lessened. So the soul likely cannot come back as whatever being it formerly was, but something lesser (lemures, etc.). And if the hag sells/barters the soul to a devil who's not outcast, the soul WILL be put into a devil to live a "new life."
Hags rarely dine on souls they capture, because they're "ruining goods" they can sell or barter. However, if they desperately want a talent the being had (spellfire wielding, for instance) and think they can get it by eating the soul, or if they are themselves  very weak or wounded, and need the life-essence, they will devour a soul they catch.
Looking at the title of what we've just heralded, soul taking MIGHT just feature in some small way in its contents

And yes, trying to become a lich by one of the popular methods is VERY dangerous. Most of those ways involve imbibing a potion of lichdom which is essentially a poison. Some who do drink, die irrevocably. See Minsc and Boo's Guide and several other canon sources

[@] This is the oldest and most random question, surely, but for the original Talis cards - do the races depicted have significance or can the cards depict any race and hold the same meanings? Ex: changing the Flames suit from Dwarves to Tieflings
In the Realms, you CAN change them (rarely done, though; tradition). I'm not sure if that holds true for Krynn, where Talis decks originated; you'd have to ask Margaret Weis or Tracy Hickman about that.

Hey [@] how does dualism work in aD&D 2e mechanics? We know elves are barred from most of specialist wizard classes. Is dualism a kit or W/W multiclass or a special class like Alunakkar, Dijakkar, Encikkar, Nelluonkkar? Would they need requirements of both base classes?
As a never-TSR-staffer, I can't give you any "official" rules answers, but I did design a lot of 2e via Realms products, and I handle it thus: most players ran generalist all-in wizards.
Anyone can dual class, but yes, must meet requirements of both base classes
Dual classes do NOT get to cast a spell from each class in the same combat round/turn/move (the internal design terminology changed over the life of 2e), but you CAN ready items and spell components as well as cast a lone spell (DM fiat prevents elaborate setups).

If that Sword Coaster sails to Chult, quite high. If not, pretty low. Few tabaxi travel unless they're strong-minded adventurers, and such individuals have usually chosen mates "already."
Is there not a small tabaxi colony located near Mornbryn’s Shield?

Hey, Ed. Writing to you again since my last post got buried. I wanted to ask about your opinion of gods and mortals having intimate, long term relationships. Like a human champion dating/marrying his goddess and the intricacies/hardships following such relationships.
I think showing such relationships in fantasy tales and games can be very interesting
Why does the deity want such a relationship? Are they lonely? If they began as mortal, do they feel what they think is their essential self slipping away? Do they need to feel love?
Reconnect?
Does the mortal get “burned” (mentally and/or physically) by divine contact? How does it change them, both mind and body? Are they doomed to perish soon, burned out? Or be forever changed? If the deity wants to keep them around, must the deity change their  essential nature to do so? And so on.
I’ve done such tales in the Realms and elsewhere, to try to explore what it means to live beyond the normal lifespan, how great power changes us, and what love is and can be.

Thank you for your response, Ed! In response to it, id say:
Lets say that the mortal is deeply in love with the god(dess) and wishes to spend eternity with them. Theyd try their absolute best to be a great, caring lover and accept the deity for who they *are.* Just genuine love.
If the deity can trust that genuine love (or mind-read to make certain of it), then the love is likely to be a bright anchor for them, to renew their energy and zest for existence and reaffirm their reasons for doing what they do.
Now, how to keep that love eternal 
I see! Then lets say the man obtains immortality and has even greater love and desire for his divine beloved. How would the god(dess) react to this? What if the man isnt necessarily a devout worshipper of the deity but still respects their portfolio and tries to help them?
What happens then depends on the character/nature of the god/goddess: how insane or hurt or damaged they may already be (how much can they trust?). If they can accept an immortal ally, then you have glory.
Not necessarily the most exciting of stories, but real glory.
With the example i mentioned earlier (Eilistraee) who is pretty healthy and considerate, lets say that the now immortal human never tires of their divine love and is overall the same being as before their ascension. No godhood, though. Just an immortal man who loves his god fully
Then he would become a treasure above all else to the goddess. A trusted friend and perhaps sometime lover, someone to relax and talk with. Someone to share with. As was said in A COLLEGE OF MAGICS: "Glove to my hand. EVERYTHING."
I see. What about marriage? Would someone like Eilistraee be willing to marry her human love and spend eternity with him, as soulmates? Would she be willing to have a family with him, if theyre on the same page? Would she get bored of him after awhile and see him more as a friend
I'd say Eilistraee would want to marry and have a forever-soulmate. I see her as wanting to have a family, though she may want to see Lolth dealt with, first (to bring children into a brighter world). Bored would depend on his depth and character; Eilistraee has had to be fierce.

not sure if you can help but what is the correct pronunciation of Drone Wyvernspur's first name. Is it simply like the modern drone or a Dro-nay?
It is properly "DOR-own" but due to his habit of sharing lore on and on and his deep, one-note voice, all of Redstone Castle took to calling him "Drone" (as in: "drone on") before "Uncle" was added to that. ;} The man didn't mind. Dorath, however, stuck with DOR-own.

Some questions only [@] can answer. . This little bit of TSR advertising came to me in a 1987 Forgotten Realms boxed set. Was there really an Order of Heroes? Did the pen of Elminster actually send these heroes parchments highlighting new material? And who was the TSR mind behind this “1960’s comic book style” marketing research plan?
It was a TSR executive's ploy to build a mailing list of potential buyers for stuff. However, not being an employee then or ever, I never learned which executive.
David Martin was editor of The Secrets of the Sages newsletter (3 issues assembled, only 1 put out).

[@] play has backed us into a corner. What is the elven menstrual cycle like in Faerun, and how do Drow differ? I know book of elves touches fertility in general and says Drow breed human fast instead, but players need cycle info specifically.
We've had a rather intense reincarnation and take the route of having big biologic changes on screen the first time or two, before it fades into the same "happens but we don't notice" that using the WC does.
The newborn Drow is quite insistent on planning this drama beforehand!
It depends on the elves; star elves can control their cycle, whereas moon elves are firmly tied to the larger moon of Toril. MOST elves have a period of four to six days (both “shoulder” days being “spotting), but these days occur every three months, not every month. Most drow, like most humans, cycle monthly. With elves as with humans, diet and other factors (being parched in drought or desert conditions, for example) can cause cycles to fade away.

[@] Hey, I have a question about a spell that came up in one of my games. We have two characters that act differently than they actually are in order to impress the other (one faking her whole personality, the other speaking with a fake accent). Would they still be able to do that while under the effect of zone of truth? Would speaking with a fake accent or acting like your personality is completely different be considered as 'lying'?
Both are deception, but they would only be revealed with the right questioning. "What are your true feelings about X?" and "Is that your real voice?" would uncover right away, but an accent is an affectation, not strictly a lie. (This comes from Sage Advice rulings.)

[@] This one is a somewhat random question, bit with the various skin tones tieflings come in, including those outside the normal range of human tones, how well do tieflings handle the sun?

I think you get the general picture. Many thanks for your creativity, and I quite enjoyed your last reply to me. #realmslore
Hi!
Tieflings handle the sun very well, but they can get sunburnt (the less crimson or scarlet their skin hue is, the more easily, so heritage does play a part). A sunburnt blue tiefling freckles brown, then goes brown in irregular patches (like a black & white cow).

Rollo [@] [@] do you know roughly where Lyonsbane Keep, the long since abandoned keep where Kelemvor's clan once resided, is located? I've found forums asking about it since 2004, but no one's ever gotten an answer. Thanks in advance!
Yes. It stood in westernmost Chessenta, due south of the southern end of the Akanapeaks, in a verdant valley within sight of the river that drains from them into the Akanamere.
Today, Lyonsbane Keep no longer exists, as it was shattered in warfare and rebuilt several times, but ultimately its stones were “robbed” from its site to make many new stone buildings.
The trouble is that the map of Chessenta changed constantly throughout the 1200s and 1300s DR, as petty baronies and self-styled dukedoms rose and fell.

Why are the prices in gold pieces when at this scale they should be in plat?
It happens all over. Shop tables, spell tables.
Spell component: crystal valued at 5000 gold pieces" depending on the edition that's 5 to 50 platinum!
Expressing in gp is the format established for the game by the creator and publisher. If publishing canon D&D, you follow the format.
Len Lakofka explained it thus: If buying a car, I expect the price to be quoted to me as "sixteen thousand dollars, not 160 hundred-dollar-bills.

Dear [@] , given the harsh Winters in the Sword Coast, would it be possible to travel by land from Daggerford to Waterdeep during the month of Hammer? Is the Trade Way open during Hammer, or the snow prevents any travel between them? Thanks in advance.
In most winters, large armed parties (because of wolves) can almost always make this trip trudging on snowshoes. What can't happen is caravan travel: i.e. bringing lots of stuff. Bringing personal gear is done by each person towing the equivalent of a loaded toboggan.

Something I have always wondered. How does Manshoon (and his seemingly endless supply of clones) remain a chosen of Mystra? How does each clone keep that, especially the one that became a Vampire?
He's not a Chosen. He rejected Mystra (see the relevant scenes in my Sage of Shadowdale trilogy). He is an (unwitting and unwilling) Weave anchor.

This was a question from Larian designers regarding the availability of locally-grown fruit in Baldur's Gate (for lore, as BG3 was being designed).
We've worked out it was for the development of Siege of Dragonspear, an expansion for Baldur's Gate 2, and that it was probably pears (but seems to have been cut from the game). Now we're just trying to work out which monks where, and if you were describing greenhouses? Thanks!
They would be monks of Chauntea, and they are using greenhouse equivalents: against the south, sunbaked stone walls of grain-barns, one builds growing frames (house-sized lean-to growing frames of timbers and enchanted "spellglass") to raise crops that really  need a warmer climate. Just as real-world gardeners do in northern cold climates, to extend growing seasons or preserve magnolias, lime trees, and other growing things that would otherwise perish over winters.
The "spellglass" is a clerical spell that  creates large sheets of clear, strong, durable glass (without many small leaded panes, or use of mica sheets, or anything else that would mar the reach of the sun's rays). Quite a few priesthoods now know and use variant spells (also for grand temple windows).

They are both, because sunlight harms them not and increasingly they dwell on the surface of Toril, in remote areas (as Lolth-worshipping drow tend to persecute them).

Hey [@] I have a bizarre Realmslore question: what’s the state of math across the realms? Are states using “Roman” numerals or have they discovered the place system? Any 10-base number sets? Has calculus been discovered and/or is it a closely guarded secret
Finally, a question more esoteric than whether there are toilets in Waterdeep.
Thorass (written Common Tongue) records numbers thus: draw a box, and fill it with vertical strokes for each ten in a number. Encircle the box with dots for each of the leftover values in a numerical total. So 81 is a box holding 8 strokes, with a dot above it, and 87 is a box of 8 strokes with a ring of 7 dots around it. For hundreds, use horizontal strokes floating atop the box, so 349 is a box of 4 strokes with three lines atop it, all encircled by 9 dots.
Most calculus is a Waukeen temple secret.

Back in May, Nahtor Raschura [@] asked me this:
My character would like to craft a weapon as a gift for his deity through the campaign. Is it possible to perform a Damascus forging process with Mithril?
Could other metals like Adamantine be used in this process?
Sorry for the delay! Life has been BUSY.
Here we go (this lore reply applies only to the Realms) 
Adamantine is the flexible/durable alloy made from the brittle, super-hard pure metal adamant (derived from the ore adamantite). Neither adamant, in any of its forms, or mithril can serve well in the Damascus forging process/pattern welding/layering and hammering; the extensive reworking involved destroys both adamantine and mithril. On the other hand, both adamantine and mithril can be cast, and “worked thrice,” and dwarves who know how can make adamantine and mithril items have edges that can be hammered and ground repeatedly to keep them sharp and true.

Hi [@] ! I'm Max. I've been playing D&D with the same character for 7 years: Draco, a half-dragon, son of an elf and a metallic dragon. I've also been a DM for RPGs and I have a question: can half-dragons have children? It's a question asked by the character himself.
The Monster Manual states that:half-dragons are incapable of naturally producing offspring. But if they cannot have children, how could a wizard of draconic origin exist? Could he be the son of a half-dragon? Or only of a pure dragon? Or is it only possible through magic/rituals?
So, to reproduce, would that only be possible through magical or ritual means? Or even through adoption? In a stable union, could a half-dragon like my character have a child? Thank you for your attention, Ed!
Many half-dragons are sterile, hence what the MM says, but they CAN have children with the right mate. What USUALLY happens is that the resulting offspring are visually human, with some draconic hidden traits, or blood heritage that comes out later on, in THEIR offspring (or a generation on). It can be something as simple as resistance or even immunity to a particular sort of breath weapon (or natural or magical equivalent).
However, the great majority of half-dragons can't give birth to "new" half-dragons.

I'm taking this and assuming the top people at every major institution that studies this, like Candlekeep, have microscopes so they can see it themselves. But the manufacturing of them is so expensive that instead of trying to get everyone else to see it, they just said, "Look, trust us. This is what you need to do."
The typical Torilian microscope is a vertical metal pole (on a tabletop) with various lenses clamped to it (think hand-held magnifying glasses but with clamp-handles) and the user peers through a combination of lenses, adjusting their heights, distances apart, and what combination of lenses on hand they're using. I think one of these snuck into the background of some FR art, years ago, partially obscured. Such arrangements are used in surgery and some delicate carving-crafting.

Hey [@] what is the Waterdeep (and other cities and states) policy when it comes to circulation of foreign currency in the city? Is there a foreign country buy back program that re-mints bullion into the local denomination? I would imagine as a trade city if they didn’t it would start to make transactions more challenging.
Officially, no: they accept all currency (it does make for some challenging transactions, especially with barter thrown in).
Unofficially: when "outland" metal coinage gets paid into city coffers, it gets melted down and reminted UNLESS there's an investigation.

This is excellent. I’m going to crunch these numbers (and the attached size chart) to calculate revise proportions. Am I correct in assuming a somewhat standard ratio of raw copper:silver:gold exchange rates throughout the Realms?
Most popular "lawful" trading centers (Silverymoon, Baldur's Gate, Athkatla, Zazesspur, the Sembian coastal cities, etc.) have coins about 80% pure. Places like Scornubel and Westgate are 60% pure; everywhere else is in the range between.
Looks sideways at Ed and whispers* "Athkatla?"
Shhh, I'm talking about the face they try to present to the world to attract trade and investment, not the truth. ;}
Is this a recent development, or is it safe to assume this was the case in the years before the Spellplague?
This was the same in the latter half of the 1300s DR, before the Spellplague.

Mind if I piggyback on this question a little? Somewhat related, haha.
If a devil was to "conjure up" tangible, non-illusory coins out of nowhere for dramatic effect over a party of adventurers like in this scene, would those coins be:  magically created, and therefore theoretically could be of greater purity (and potentially value) than traditionally minted ones regular ol' pre-existing coins summoned from a secret stash hoarded just for such occasions
Option 2 is what I imagined when I wrote this scene I wrote Alexander as a Cambion with sorcerer levels, certainly not all-powerful, but REALLY good with theatrics and with a hefty Charisma stat. Did I get it right?
I would go with Option 2 IF the devil had no access to (their own personal, as that's what it would be) stash of coins. If they had a stash big enough to do things with, Option 1, because it increases their long-term influence wherever they're handing out the coins.
Is creating gold out of (practically) nothing that easy for fiends?
If it were accessible to humanoids, I imagine the economy of the Realms would be as messy as the death toll in Westeros.
The fiend is transforming (in shape) and transporting (from elsewhere) gold, NOT creating it, or transmuting it from another metal.

Speaking of dragons, two questions.
If a chromatic dragon egg were given to a metallic dragon to raise, would the chromatic dragon grow up with the same personality traits (even if struggling with bad impulses), or are chromatic dragons evil by nature, cursed as such forever?
They are born with the personality traits of their blood heritage (chromatic type), but nurture often trumps nature, and when out on their own, dragons are intelligent and long-lived enough to make their own decisions, have time to change their world-views often.
This holds true in both directions. And is one of the things that makes dragons so interesting as characters (not just antagonists) in the setting.

And is the reverse the same?
Are dragonborn a race of live births or egg hatching? And what if they bred with half-dragons or dragons?
MOST dragonborn births are live, but the baby emerges in a porous, rubbery caul (membrane), which is what the egg of dragons has morphed into for dragonborn (it can readily be broken from inside or outside).
Dragonborn interbred offspring usually "favor" one parent or the other so much that the baby effectively IS a half-dragon or dragon (but with hidden traits/"wild talents" from their dragonborn side). Note that babies being dragons is VERY rare, and often involves a transformation from dragonborn form later in life. This can often come as a surprise to the partially-grown-up dragonborn baby, and may be triggered by traumatic events or direct personal threats. (E.g. dragonborn makes a battlefield last stand and is astonished to become a dragon while doing so.)

To that end, how likely is it that a grown dragon would change alignment?
Likely" is an "it depends" answer for each dragon (in this case, depends foremost on how the dragon is treated by kin/and friends (if any), then by other dragons, then by other creatures, in their unfolding life as a dragon. It tends to be rare rather than common.

Makes it hard to distinguish between half-dragons and dragonborn.
Which makes me wonder, what if half-dragons and dragonborn were to breed with humanoids, and how would the future descendants fare further down the line?
Over time, species lines become more blurred, everything tending towards the individual and not groups.
As I recall, somewhere in past TSR lore are some scribbled design thots on half-dragons, saurials, and (Krynn) dragonborn

Can a wizard, or other individual academically inclined towards alchemy, be reasonably expected to be capable of brewing potions or other items that could aid recovery, be they antiseptics, antidotes, or outright healing wounds, given the right ingredients and tools?
Capable, yes. Whether a particular wizard can do it depends on what training they’ve received or books/scrolls/tutoring they have access to. Any mage who has studied alchemy at all can understand how to try for purity, and how to intensify or dilute a result but knowing techniques is just the beginning. Alchemy is a process of experimentation, refining, adjusting, and experimenting again to get closer and closer.
However, given the right ingredients and tools, someone used to precision, who has studied alchemy sufficiently, should be able to concoct, their first time out, a reasonably powerful antiseptic, and an antidote that can treat symptoms (such as seizures, swellings, impaired vision or other senses). Better antiseptics and antidotes that work on root conditions can be produced through additional experimentation.

Rx What about magically resistant bacteria? magic resistance might require 5 cure diseases instead of one, for example
In the Realms, magically resistant bacteria are only going to come into being in a living organism that tarries (or is caught) inside a magically-strong area (e.g. within a mythal), or feels the effects of a powerful (7th level or higher) spell.
So they will exist, but be rare. A cure disease will always initially work on them 100% (that is, removing all effects/making the disease latent so it seems to have “ended,” but then will come back, far more mildly, later (how long, up to the DM; how severe, depends on all sorts of factors, including overall health of the afflicted. .but as a DM, I would never rule on anything needing more than three cure diseases: the third casting should end a disease for good.

something I have never grasped. How or why did the Sarrukh fall and run from the Khaasta? As I recall they didn't have any abilities. Just demonic allies? Even in defeat why does the Sarrukh fear the Khaasta?
The Sarrukh fear the Khaasta because Sess'innek had a scheme to physically transform Sarrukh (the only Sarrukh not destined to die as sacrifices to him!) into servitor lizards (some into the lizard equivalent of hounds or war wolves, some into a “pack lizard”/wagon-pulling-beast role). The transformation made the mind of the transformed Sarrukh unable to resist mental commands from any Khaasta—so no Sarrukh wanted to be anywhere near a Khaasta, for any reason, for fear of being instantly mind-controlled. (There was so much fearful misinformation among Sarrukh about this, that they didn’t know the mind control only “worked” after they’d been transformed; a belief spread that Sess'innek was altering Khaasta to be able to pre-emptively control the minds of nearby Sarrukh.) Hence the “running and hiding."

Belatedly, a reply to:
Herald[@] (from June 13th of this year):
Sorry to bother you but I just learned about the dragon Alorglauvenemaus, but I can't seem to find what turned him and El into enemies to the point where El would kill him and in Elminster Enraged they seem like they are on bad terms already. I hope this isn't too much of a bother, I just am really interested in him. Thank you for your time."
Right, I've checked through the NDAs, and here we go 
The dragon Alorglauvenemaus long maintained a Zhentarim wizard alter ego, Hesperdan.
Elminster mind-melded with him to show him what the Chosen of Mystra did, and why, so he’d be informed enough to temper both his own draconic ambitions and the overbold excesses of the Zhentarim, to prevent open and widespread war from flaring up on dozens of occasions (Hesperdan thwarted, distracted, convinced, or in some cases outright slew amibitious Zhentarim who would have sacrificed much of the Realms to rise within the ranks of the Zhentarim). After centuries, their silent partnership, which extended to aiding each other in confrontations against foes, and even “swapping bodies” (altering their outward shapes to impersonate each other, not really exchanging bodies) to stand in for each other, ended when Alorglauvenemaus gave in to his own ambitions and took advantage of Fzoul’s hubris and “defeat” of Manshoon (not knowing Manshoon was playing a ruse of his own to step aside from the target-on-his-back leadership role) to try to grasp his own lordship within the Zhentarim; he was seeking a role that can best be described as “behind the scenes office manager, holding a lot of real daily power but almost no official authority
As Hesperdan, Alorglauvenemaus slew a lot of senior Zhents (especially priests of Bane) to carve out his chosen role, and that was fine with Elminster (who once described this to Ed of the Greenwood as “playing Bane like a fiddle,” as Alorglauvenemaus intended to substitute rule by fear for official authority, a style that delighted Bane the Lord of Tyranny, so Bane lifted no finger against him), but the dragon then went on to try to exterminate every loyal servant of Mystra and Azuth whom he thought might have any inkling that he was Hesperdan, and had worked with Elminster—and that was NOT acceptable to Elminster. That’s the “treachery” El refers to when ending Alorglauvenemaus with silver fire. (Mystra and Azuth were fine with El slaying Alorglauvenemaus due to the body count the dragon had already wrought, though they are normally reluctant to indulge in open slaughter because of the “tit for tat” feuds it can cause; in this case, Alorglauvenemaus was piling death upon death, beyond his original targets.)
Elminster still respected Alorglauvenemaus for the entire “being Hesperdan” thing and the work they’d done together. He was saddened that the dragon had given in to his hunger for power and control, rather than “rising above himself” farther (his Hesperdan persona was already a measure of rising above himself). El wanted to go on liking the dragon.

Hello Mr. Greenwood, what kind of bottle does Cormyrean Mint Wine get stored in? if it gets stored in a bottle at all? i love your setting so much <3
That depends on who buys it from the vintner. Most wine of this sort is consumed locally; it's poured into skins (sealed leather sacks) for travel, and decanted into stoppered decanters for home use.
Bottles are of course hand-blown in a glassworks, which can be located anywhere a forge can be set up (so Suzail, Immersea, Waymoot, and other locales where there's a demand, and the right sort of sand is handy). Sometimes shape and hue of bottles are used to identify contents; mint wine is not a "haughty" wine, and so will often be put into "handrounds" (think of the sort of bottle real-world Mateus wine is often sold in, only Realms versions of this bottle shape tend to have "shoulder grooves" so a user can grip them more securely with thumb and forefingers) rather than the tall, thin "spearhead" bottle shapes (think of real-world ice wine bottles for tall-thin-ness, but tapering to a point rather than having shoulders, and having flared bases so they don't tip over as easily) used for expensive, highly-regarded vintages.

A quick Q for [@] any other names that Silverymoon (the city) is called by? Poetic, informal, etc.? I really enjoyed “The Great Silver Hearth”, from My Slice of Silverymoon, and got emotional about what an amazing a city it is. Any others that the wiki hasn’t covered?
Sure!
The Shining Towers, Silvertowers, Homehaven (an elven name for the city), and The Welcoming City.

What about Neverwinter black icewine?
What even is icewine? I can't imagine putting wine on ice is either easy or expensive, especially without magic.
Heh. Icewine is made from frozen grapes; the water freezes into ice, so it concentrates the grape juice. Icewine/ice wine is expensive because relatively rare, because conditions have to be just right to yield the necessary grapes. It's a sweet dessert wine.
Neverwinter black icewine is sold in small handkegs (about the size of a cylindrical mid-sized watermelon) for distance transport, and in adult-human-male-forearm-sized, tall cylindrical bottles within Neverwinter.

I have a burning need to know what any Underdark race's reaction to finding a surface junk food like this one 😂 Disappointment for it being not actually a mushroom? Or delight at the utterly insane sugar content? Lmao
Folk of the Underdark are used to all manner of cap-fungi, and are used to deception. They would be wary.
The sheer sweetness of it would be a dumbfounding revelation. There'd be delight and a murderous need to possess all supplies of it.

What else do Underfolk tend to eat? I'm assuming whatever meat they can get their hands on is "foul" would be a kind description.
I've covered this a time or six before, but the short answers are:
Fungi. Lots and lots of fungi.
Snails. Slimes. And lizards (worn-out pack lizards and all of the smaller varieties).

Does that include the richer races, such as the drow?
Yes. These things form the bulk of drow diets. Drow also (due to surface raids and trade) have access to other foodstuffs, but due to ongoing rarity these are "treats" (expensive). The drow do rear herds of pack lizards and farm "forests" of fungi in guarded caverns.

I have another question that I'd really like an answer to, but I don't know if it's NDA or if you've simply never seen it.
Unrelated, but who were the rules of Neverwinter from the days of Halueth Never up to those of Nasher Alagondar?
And how was the succession line, given that Nasher only took the title of king later on?
And more to the point, how did Nasher become Lord Protector?
Yep. I've done a video on this, and it says everything I can say without smashing several NDAs (thanks to Neverwinter being a 4e Realms focus). Sorry. For now; may be able to say more later.

What are the common flavors and textures in Underdark cuisine?
Thanks to the prevalence of fungi, a texture that can best be described as “rubbery to chewy” is prevalent in Underdark cuisine. Things that crunch are rarities.
Edible fungi cover a broad range of colours (though dun-browns to darker browns predominate, with purple being the next most popular—and never attempt to eat any fungi that look green) and shapes, from flaky spikes and “ledges” to shelf fungi, spears like asparagus, and various cap shapes with stalks, from tall and smooth to short and shaggy; literally just about everything.
These Underdark fungi offer flavours from salty or bitter and smoky to an almost vanilla-like sweetness; again, just about everything, including flavours that a blindfolded surface-dweller sampling them might mistake for roast beef or braised roth
Certain common fungi can be cooked to mush and then to an oil that thickens into a spreadable paste when taken off the heat, and this serves as a hummus-like “butter” (that can take on the flavour of herbs stirred into it, like garlic or dill into “real butter” derived from the milk of surface-dwelling creatures) when spread on other edibles. This is usually called “rarthree” by folk of the Underdark, regardless of species (though deep gnomes tend to shorten this to just “rarth” in casual speech).
The meat of the many edible lizards are often sliced into thin steaks and fried in rarthee, and tend to taste rather like real-world kangaroo meat; slightly gamier than boar or beef or rothé, but still striking the palate as “red meat” rather than fish or reptile. Pack lizards have the strongest taste, increasing with age and size, and Volo found it to be a curious cross between the fat of very well-marbled steaks, and bacon fat—without grease or the heaviness of fat.
Soups in the Underdark tend to all be thick enough to be called “stews” on the surface world, with diced chunks of meat or fungi, and almost all of them use simmered, reduced fungi as a base. “Superior” soups include the blood of slain edible creatures, which enriches the flavour and thins the texture. Large root vegetables such as potatoes are almost unknown in Underdark cuisine, yet their blandness would cause them to be “shrug” curiosities, not highly-prized novelties, if sampled.

if a Matron or another power/influential Lolthian drow was going to visit a Major city in the realms, on the surface, how could they legally/ legitimately do so (assuming the city would allow it given the right circumstances)?
By far the easiest way of doing this is for the Lolthite drow to pose (or even legitimately arrange such a title and position) as the trade envoy of a distant surface realm or city-state, and make the visit “working” travel to negotiate and sign agreements about goods, taxes and tariffs, and limits of imports and exports for the surface realm or city-state.
They could of course quietly also represent their own and/or other Underdark communities for the same things during the same visit. Such a ploy will allow them to bring bodyguards and unusual wares (or even magic items for their own defense or offense) as “samples

Give an Underdark commoner a KitKat and watch their mind explode
That exact thing happened in a Milwaukee-era GenCon game I ran.
A small, overmatched female thief caught red-handed by two drow sentries gave them KitKat bars she'd stolen from Elminster (who stole them from me), and fled while they were literally running around shrieking in delight.
And by "gave" the KitKats, I mean she did a big act of weeping and trying to hide her "precious healing treasure" when they body-searched her.
So of course they took the bars and taunted her by eating them right away, in front of her.

Not deep rothe? I'm sure I read mention of rothe in the Underdark in some of the AD&D era Forgotten Realms novels I loved as a teen.
There are very few "wild" deep rothé herds left in the Underdark; they've been captured and are now the carefully-farmed exclusive food larders of particular communities. So they've disappeared from "general Underdark" larders and tables.
Cities with those herds, yes!
