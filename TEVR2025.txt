Hello Mr. Greenwood! I have a question. One of my players wants to literally remove ALL evil from the universe. He’s pretty confident that he can pull it off. Besides the forces of evil is there anything else preventing him from doing this?
Yes, unfortunately.
Time (as in, his limited lifespan: there's a LOT of evil to "remove").
Method: he must be very careful about how he removes evil, lest he become evil himself during the process.
Judgement: one person's "evil" may not be the same as another's. Ethical code?

Spelljammer fans: Has anyone ever done anything with [@] "dead world of Ambereye"?: https://thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?t=35099
Big Mac is trying to figure out how to extrapolate the crystal sphere out in a Greenwoodian way.
What do you think Ed was thinking?
I often wonder what Ed was thinking, myself
However, in this case, I can impart this much: there’s a crystal sphere now called Hulthoonar by its inhabitants. At its heart is a darker-than-flame-orange star called “Ambereye,” and its solar system had two earth-like  planets: one named Ambereye after the home star, and another named Hulthoon. They were home to rival civilizations of sentient, human-like upright bipeds that made war on each other, using magic. After a long struggle (actually, a series of skirmishes with rebuilding and  magic-experimentation time between them), the Amberites lost and their world was devastated; it’s now “dead,” in an eternal twilight of particle-laded dust clouds that block sunlight, so nothing grows. Hulthoon was much humbled in the strife and has reverted to  medieval-era “small warring baronies with much mistrust of magic and those who wield it.” The hidden stronghold of Thurdle is on Hulthoon’s wilder, monster-roamed continent. So are many dragons, but the monster hunters never hunt so close to home, and park their ship  away from Hulthoon to avoid being detected by those who still command magic enough to scry afar and reach out with destructive power. Instead, they hunt on the three moons of Hulthoon, very large satellites (as moons go) that are home to roaming herds of cloven-hoofed  beasts, and the dragons who prey at will on them—and not inhabited by Hulthoonar.
The Thurdle Mages were Hulthoonar themselves, but fled their world to avoid constant persecution by magic-fearing, mage-hating fellow Hulthoonar. They are warily building their personal  magical power over time, ere they risk voyaging out of their sphere to hunt more widely, though some of them dream of richer hunting grounds and greater magely power.
So there you have it. More that hit the cutting-room floor (before I made turnover; LOST SHIPS was  written VERY quickly to launch the series of accessories, so there was no time to give the in-house editors extra work: I wrote, Jeff did initial concept/game design edit, and we hurled it into the hopper).
So there you have it! Expand away!!!

Hi, Mr Greenwood, just wanted to ask, is there a mason's guild in Baldur's Gate ? And if so, in which district would it be located ? Asking for a character with the Guild Artisan background.
Yes. The Guild of Masons, Stonecutters, and Hard-Sculptors (“Stoneheads” in Baldurian street slang) is now newly headquartered on the northwestern edge of Stonyeyes district in the Outer City, and “runs” of dressed building stone from its sorting yards (the  space needs of which have forced this guild to move several times, abandoning their initial location in Lower City’s Brampton district for progressively “distant” locations) run along Wall Lane between the Guildyard Gates and the city’s Basilisk Gate.

Hello [@] i would like to create a campaign with a crinti battle sorcerer/rogue/spellwarp sniper, but i have a doubt : could a male crinti could officially be a sorcerer, or all form of magic is prohibed for males in Dambrath ? Thank you ! #Realmslore
A male crinti could indeed be a sorcerer. The prohibition is on TRAINING males in arcane spellcraft, so those who wield magic without that sort of training get around it and are tolerated in the society. Watched, but tolerated.

[@] i am very curious if you have answered this in a video or plan to in the future, or even on here; what is the cutlure of magic in the forgotten realms, more specifically how do the mages of various types view each other?
This question comes up often, but my answer is usually a variation of the same thing: attitudes vary widely by individual and from time to time and place to place. If you live near a major temple, the “line” preached by local clerics affects you (pro or con) and if you’re in Cormyr, and the War Wizards are part of state enforcement, you may love law and order (their protection) or detest it. If local wizards protect you often against dragon or wyvern raids, you prize them. .but what if a rumour arises that they 
ARE the raiding dragons or wyverns (transforming themselves)? And so on
It’s important to remember two things: communications is slower and much patchier in the Realms than in our modern world, so “widely shared” attitudes can’t be changed quickly and are  often influenced by gossip, and “everybody knows” magic is everywhere, like sunrises and sunsets and stars, not something that one can easily choose to shun or work against; you grow up with it, just like you grow up eating and breathing.

Lil Bo Creep [@] so normal about the seven sisters; what’s Alustriel been up to since resigning from overseeing Silverymoon? Storm?
See the FR Wiki entry for Alustriel, specifically the “After the Spellplague” section, and the recent Wizards of the 
Coast adventure “Vecna: Eve Of Ruin
As for Storm, see her entry in the FR Wiki. Since Mordenkainen’s recovery, Storm has happily tutored many Harpers in her farmhouse in Shadowdale.

[@] Me and my friends got into an argument lately. Is "Lake of Dragons" actually a lake, or already a part of the sea? We can't get to agreement on this topic.
If you mean the Dragonmere, it is an arm of the sea, a "long bay" or arm of the Sea of Fallen Stars/Inner Sea. "Lake of Dragons" is the most popular name for it, but is fanciful, originating in a bard's ballad about dragons.

This is super fascinating! Which Bard wrote it? Does this ballad have a name?
The bard Ghellyn Mrustroke, of Chessenta, first began performing the ballad in 1296 DR, and expanded on and improved it over the next dozen years. It survives him as a seldom-performed but respected lay, “Wyrms All Around Us

The published version of the Undermountain megadungeon did not use Ed Greenwood's original maps. Were these ever shared or published anywhere (whether in whole or in part)? If not, would it be possible to publish these at some point?
See all the orange areas, and the blue (flooded) passage? All part of my original map. What happened was that TSR didn't have time to redraw my original faint pencil maps (with my tiny handwriting all over them), so Dave Sutherland donated some of his  gigantic rooms Empire of the Petal Throne campaign maps, and stuck them in all around the edges. Yes, the other nine levels of "my original" Undermountain never got published, but I submitted them so TSR owns them, so I can't publish them elsewhere now.
I can't believe they sold this friggin empty dungeon. It still makes me mad.
Yep. My original was completely detailed. Every room, every passage, all the connections with the sewers and with the surface city. All the cabals and gangs using "their little bit" of Undermountain, and dreading intruders "from below

Ed, I'm curious. I've heard rumors and stories – almost myths, really – that Elminster got tired of magic, retired, and started a little winery. Is that actually true? 
Tired of magic? Not true. Tire of living? Several times. Retired: three times, but Mystra won't let him stay retired. Little wineries started: two, so far. An ice creamery, last time

Have you considered doing a lives let's play one-off based in your version of the realms, wether as part of a charity event or as a self created event?
Have done that a time or two, down the years, at various conventions, either free or as a your-seat-buy goes to a local charity the con is supporting.

[@] As the creator of the Alhoon, do you think it would be suitable to play one with a camp, Vincent Price-esque personality, or would that work better with a classic humanoid skeleton lich? I love the aesthetics of both types of lich for that.
Certainly. The classic humanoid lich would be more prone to that sort of personality, but both sorts of liches could greet the world as Vincent Price's frequent on-screen persona did. Neither of them would likely have his foodie side, though. :}
