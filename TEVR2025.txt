Hello Mr. Greenwood! I have a question. One of my players wants to literally remove ALL evil from the universe. He’s pretty confident that he can pull it off. Besides the forces of evil is there anything else preventing him from doing this?
Yes, unfortunately.
Time (as in, his limited lifespan: there's a LOT of evil to "remove").
Method: he must be very careful about how he removes evil, lest he become evil himself during the process.
Judgement: one person's "evil" may not be the same as another's. Ethical code?

Spelljammer fans: Has anyone ever done anything with [@] "dead world of Ambereye"?: https://thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?t=35099
Big Mac is trying to figure out how to extrapolate the crystal sphere out in a Greenwoodian way.
What do you think Ed was thinking?
I often wonder what Ed was thinking, myself. ;}
However, in this case, I can impart this much: there’s a crystal sphere now called Hulthoonar by its inhabitants. At its heart is a darker-than-flame-orange star called “Ambereye,” and its solar system had two earth-like  planets: one named Ambereye after the home star, and another named Hulthoon. They were home to rival civilizations of sentient, human-like upright bipeds that made war on each other, using magic. After a long struggle (actually, a series of skirmishes with rebuilding and  magic-experimentation time between them), the Amberites lost and their world was devastated; it’s now “dead,” in an eternal twilight of particle-laded dust clouds that block sunlight, so nothing grows. Hulthoon was much humbled in the strife and has reverted to  medieval-era “small warring baronies with much mistrust of magic and those who wield it.” The hidden stronghold of Thurdle is on Hulthoon’s wilder, monster-roamed continent. So are many dragons, but the monster hunters never hunt so close to home, and park their ship  away from Hulthoon to avoid being detected by those who still command magic enough to scry afar and reach out with destructive power. Instead, they hunt on the three moons of Hulthoon, very large satellites (as moons go) that are home to roaming herds of cloven-hoofed  beasts, and the dragons who prey at will on them—and not inhabited by Hulthoonar.
The Thurdle Mages were Hulthoonar themselves, but fled their world to avoid constant persecution by magic-fearing, mage-hating fellow Hulthoonar. They are warily building their personal  magical power over time, ere they risk voyaging out of their sphere to hunt more widely, though some of them dream of richer hunting grounds and greater magely power.
So there you have it. More that hit the cutting-room floor (before I made turnover; LOST SHIPS was  written VERY quickly to launch the series of accessories, so there was no time to give the in-house editors extra work: I wrote, Jeff did initial concept/game design edit, and we hurled it into the hopper).
So there you have it! Expand away!!!

Hi, Mr Greenwood, just wanted to ask, is there a mason's guild in Baldur's Gate ? And if so, in which district would it be located ? Asking for a character with the Guild Artisan background.
Yes. The Guild of Masons, Stonecutters, and Hard-Sculptors (“Stoneheads” in Baldurian street slang) is now newly headquartered on the northwestern edge of Stonyeyes district in the Outer City, and “runs” of dressed building stone from its sorting yards (the  space needs of which have forced this guild to move several times, abandoning their initial location in Lower City’s Brampton district for progressively “distant” locations) run along Wall Lane between the Guildyard Gates and the city’s Basilisk Gate.

Hello [@] i would like to create a campaign with a crinti battle sorcerer/rogue/spellwarp sniper, but i have a doubt : could a male crinti could officially be a sorcerer, or all form of magic is prohibed for males in Dambrath ? Thank you ! #Realmslore
A male crinti could indeed be a sorcerer. The prohibition is on TRAINING males in arcane spellcraft, so those who wield magic without that sort of training get around it and are tolerated in the society. Watched, but tolerated.

[@] i am very curious if you have answered this in a video or plan to in the future, or even on here; what is the cutlure of magic in the forgotten realms, more specifically how do the mages of various types view each other?
This question comes up often, but my answer is usually a variation of the same thing: attitudes vary widely by individual and from time to time and place to place. If you live near a major temple, the “line” preached by local clerics affects you (pro or con) and if you’re in Cormyr, and the War Wizards are part of state enforcement, you may love law and order (their protection) or detest it. If local wizards protect you often against dragon or wyvern raids, you prize them. .but what if a rumour arises that they 
ARE the raiding dragons or wyverns (transforming themselves)? And so on
It’s important to remember two things: communications is slower and much patchier in the Realms than in our modern world, so “widely shared” attitudes can’t be changed quickly and are  often influenced by gossip, and “everybody knows” magic is everywhere, like sunrises and sunsets and stars, not something that one can easily choose to shun or work against; you grow up with it, just like you grow up eating and breathing.

If you mean the Dragonmere, it is an arm of the sea, a "long bay" or arm of the Sea of Fallen Stars/Inner Sea. "Lake of Dragons" is the most popular name for it, but is fanciful, originating in a bard's ballad about dragons.

The published version of the Undermountain megadungeon did not use Ed Greenwood's original maps. Were these ever shared or published anywhere (whether in whole or in part)? If not, would it be possible to publish these at some point?
See all the orange areas, and the blue (flooded) passage? All part of my original map. What happened was that TSR didn't have time to redraw my original faint pencil maps (with my tiny handwriting all over them), so Dave Sutherland donated some of his  gigantic rooms Empire of the Petal Throne campaign maps, and stuck them in all around the edges. Yes, the other nine levels of "my original" Undermountain never got published, but I submitted them so TSR owns them, so I can't publish them elsewhere now.
I can't believe they sold this friggin empty dungeon. It still makes me mad.
Yep. My original was completely detailed. Every room, every passage, all the connections with the sewers and with the surface city. All the cabals and gangs using "their little bit" of Undermountain, and dreading intruders "from below."

Certainly. The classic humanoid lich would be more prone to that sort of personality, but both sorts of liches could greet the world as Vincent Price's frequent on-screen persona did. Neither of them would likely have his foodie side, though. :}

[@] Hey there, Ed. My group is currently in the Plains of Purple Dust, and have lots of questions about the purple dust itself. Mostly, we are wondering: Where does this purple dust come from?
Like most deserts, the dust is simply the grit (tiny particles of rock) that are so light, among the sand of that dessicated area, that they blow around in even the faintest breezes. I’ll be doing a YouTube video a few months from now about why the dust of  this particular desert is purple (and turns the sky crimson where it isn’t amethyst, due to hanging in the air as sunlight beats down). Hint: if you can detect magic, the dust radiates magic. Meaning some magical event or discharge of some great power, long  ago, made the dust purple (and likely created the desert).
For now, let's just say the Realms has a very magical past. In this case involving conflict, liches, and dragons 
Is this event related to either the Imaskari or the Mulan people when they reigned over there? Or maybe even further back in time with the Batrachi?
A long time ago. ;}
So not purple worm dandruff then?
Not. ;}

Hey [@] the revival of Tyr in the Second Sundering, Torm seems like he "disappeared." As an avid Champion of Torm lover, is Torm still around in FR, and do his followers still follow the Penance of century past?
Torm is very much “still around” in the Realms circa 1500 DR, his church small but energetic and very much a “factor on the local scene” in most places on Faerûn. His devout followers still perform the Penance of Duty; doing so shapes and guides their lives.

[@] Hello from France,
I'm an old DM and a great fan of Forgotten Realms.
Currently I'm running a campaign near Tuern and particularly Uttersea. I wasn't able to find a map of that small town.
Do you have any advise for its design please.
Sure!
Originally, the volcanic island was known as Uttersea, as to seafaring Northmen it marked the beginning of vast open seas, uncharted and “empty of all but storms.” The rich volcanic soil, coupled with the volcanic heat that still warms the half-collapsed #realmslore caldera and the bay that now fills its missing southern arc, made it great for farming, so the Northmen seized it and settled. The land became known as Tuern after an early leader, and the settlement known as Uttersea. It was settled haphazardly, but frequent  landslides forced a design on it that persists today: stone wharves jut out into the bay and are joined together along the shore into a hard “dock” with two large “beaching ramps” where ships large and small can be winched ashore; upland of both ramps are large  shipbuilding sheds.
Above them, Uttersea climbs the slopes of the caldera, which are thickly planted with clinging vines and stunted shrubs and trees to anchor the “clinker” stone-rubble-dominated soil as much as possible.
Streets follow a switchback pattern: : from the ends of the dock, packed-clinker roads curve along the caldera parallel to the dock, like rice-growing terraces on slopes in parts of the real-world Far East, with NO direct uphill/downhill routes, just the curves at both ends of the parallel runs.
The best houses are located as high as possible, off to the sides of the main “bands” of streets on their own side-lanes.

Hey Ed, I had a question I couldn't find an answer to. I've been trying to understand the timeline of the changes to FR cosmology, but and a few things struck me as odd. I was thinking about the implications of the switches between the Great Wheel and the World Tree mostly  such as, first and foremost, why and how did the cosmology switch, both in-world and out-of-game? It seems as though the outer planes were in a sort of WIP state behind the curtain, which nobody could access during the Era of Upheaval. What happened to the planes that got cut?
I'm also curious to know what the design intention was for this change and if you had any inside knowledge on how/why this was needed from an IRL executive standpoint, and what involvement you might've had on designing the World Tree/Axis models, if any. Appreciate you
I don't know why the cosmology was changed; I've never been on staff at either TSR or Wizards, and that was an internal design decision. I can only speculate. One thing I have heard is that it covered for "getting rid of" problematic plane names like "Happy Hunting Grounds."

Could you clarify this for us?
Yes. The D&D in-house design thinking has always been that NATURAL iron or copper in the earth is no hindrance to druidic magic, but REFINED, concentrated metal items ("cold iron") is. When the Realms was made a D&D setting, that became canon for the Realms.

[@] Hello from Minnesota, this past weekend my party and I were investigating sightings of red clothed wizards about a days ride from Waterdeep when we thought of a question. What does being healed by magic feel like? We came to the conclusion that (1/2) having your bones rapidly mended, muscle stitched, and flesh healed would probably hurt like a bitch and then be hot and itchy afterwards whether by potion or spell. Just curious if that’s a correct assumption or not
Thank you for your time and have a good day. (2/2)
The answer is: it varies depending on what sort of being is healing, what damage is being healed, and what magic is being used.
It's always "a rush," meaning: an excited, tingling, energy rushing through you sensation.
What varies is how painful it is, and if you feel hot, cold, or otherwise. "New" (replaced) bits of you often itch for a day or three afterwards, yes. Lower-level spells shield the recipient less against pain and shock; more powerful spells are "gentler."
There are instances in Realmsplay at the "home"  table where individuals being healed in battle, while active, by touch spells, roared out in agony as they were being healed.

Speaking from ignorance here. If Ed created the FR and what we see on the actual game differs from time to time, they can just make the changes? :o
When TSR purchased the Realms in 1986, they acquired the right to make changes, add things, and take things away. What I say and write about the Realms is canon, unless or until they contradict or change it, in print. So, yes, they can just make the changes. ;}

[@] question for you, if i may! Big fan of Forgotten Realms and im currently running a campaign set in the Silver Marches, are there any tidbits you could share about maybe a city or area in the region that isn't in a published work or similar? Thanks! #Realmslore
Sure! Over at my Discord server, Greenwood’s Grotto, I answer Realmslore queries as often as I can grab the time.
From a reply I just made there, here’s an establishment in the city of Sundabar that welcomes adventurers of all races, from drow to aarakocra, and  lizardfolk to dragonborn:
Brokh’s Tankard. In the hovels and older warehouses that crowd the eastern verges of Sundabar is this adventurers’ favorite, a low dive of a tavern that consists of a dank, gloomy stone-walled taproom of many alcoves and candle-wheel  lamps hanging from massive chains. This great room has kitchens and pantries behind it to the left, jakes behind it to the right, and in between passages that descend in long, curving ramps, to connect to a descending series of cellars, also given over to  tables for dining and drinking. The seventh and eighth cellars have side-tunnels leading to rooms that can be rented for the night, for travelers desiring accommodations or drunkards too gone to find their ways home, and the ninth and lowest cellar is where  the kegs of merriment are stored.
The founding dwarf, “Brokh” (more formally, Barrokhuld the Younger, of Clan Vorstone), is long dead, but his descendants still own and run the place. With the aid of some living spells who inhabit the cellars (guarding the  strong drink in the ninth level, by the way) and about whom locals tell all manner of conflicting and colorful origin stories.
In Sundabar, Brokh’s Tankard is best known for the Burning of the Beards, a battle that almost destroyed the tavern, and began with  a 1362 DR duergar raid on some shield dwarves drinking at the Tankard, whom the two-dozen-strong duergar regarded as trade rivals hampering their prosperity in “their” region of the Underdark.
Ironically, they were entirely entirely mistaken, attacking the  wrong dwarves, and paid for this error with their lives, though they took over a dozen dwarves, and about twenty other drinkers, with them. They began their attack with fire magic directed at the beards of their targets, and the taproom was a scorched shell by the time the last duergar was overwhelmed and hacked down—with three clerics and a mage battling the flames to quench them and save that end of Sundabar from a widespread inferno. To this day, torches, lanterns, and fire spells are still forbidden for guests  of the tavern to bring or wield.
And there you have it: a meeting and hiring place for adventurers, a "base" if you'd like. I have literally hundreds of small lore tidbits about the Sword Coast North; is there anything SORT of lore that would be particularly helpful?

Hey [@]
A while back, I asked a question about mapping Ostoria before it fell. Trying to pin point the locations (so I've found Nedeheim and Helligheim), and seeing how much territory it had before the fell. You think you could help a Giant Fan out?
I have done very little with Ostoria, and would have to lean on my "Lore Lords" of the Realms, like Eric L Boyd and George Krashos, but in general: giants ranged far and wide over the lands in their day, with their own "hunting grounds" (includes foraging) venturing far from Ostoria, which was more a tucked-away, mountain-girt refuge that giants visited when they felt the need, rather than "the country in which all giants dwelt."
So, not a huge territory. Let me rummage in the lorefiles and get back to you.

My characters will have to stop on by one day and have a drink or two.
My Tankard lore is part of a lore reply on "Unsafe Havens:" taverns, inns, and other gathering places that welcome or tolerate "very different from the norm" adventurers.
A few months from now, look for a Realmslore video (on my Patreon or YouTube) exploring half a dozen of them.

What's the most significant thing they "just changed" from the original?
Putting real-world cultures (or Hollywood versions of them) into the Realms.
Then replacing my Moonshaes with the TSR UK Albion setting.
Then changing the gods and deleting assassins for a D&D game edition change (Time of Troubles).
Then the 100-year time jump of 4th edition.
Oh huh.
I always thought the "Human cultures migrating from Earth to Faerun via magic" was an original element from you. Did not know that was TSR.
I had gates linking many parallel Prime Material Planes (our real Earth and the Realms among them) but secretive traders and fugitives used them, not invading armies bringing entire cultures with them.
What about melting a glacier to add the bloodstone lands?
That, too! ;}
Are they going to do anything more with Alu-Fiends? Asking for reasons.
I don't know.
I've never been on staff at either TSR or Wizards, and so wouldn't know content details until I bought a release at my gaming store. If I was involved in writing/designing something, NDAs would prevent me saying anything pre-release. Sorry!

I got a Drow male, minor noble house from Maerimydra who did some stuff that had him running from the city (lucky for him Kurgoths Sack went down right after and his family had bigger, hotter problems). What food might such a Drow probably find himself liking on the surface?
Drow are as varied in their culinary tastes as, say, humans, but MOST drow from the Underdark will fall in love with fresh fruit of all sorts (and degrees of sweetness/tartness) thanks to the juicyness and flavors.
Nicely-seasoned and prepared snake, eel, and  edible beetle innards (and shrimp, crab, and lobster for the same consistencies) are closer to the non-fungi edibles drow like in the Underdark, so will be more “familiar” to him, and so feel “safer” and substantial as meals.
And finally, the variety of edible surface fleshy mushrooms and fungi will seem to him as if he went from “three varieties of meat at local shops” to “a huge buffet of all sorts of meat” for him to sample.
Everything else will be an acquired taste, but green vegetables (peas, lettuce, celery cucumbers) will be the most exotic, and will either revolt him forever, or be “dicey” at first but then become his sought-afters. Spices and herbs of the surface will be a constant learning curve, and sweet confections (sugar-coated breadstuffs!) may be a  shock, or a delight! (Happy roleplaying!)

[@] in Hand of Fire, one "Weave-wraith" dies; in web article, Alustriel bound the others. https://web.archive.org/web/20050212042733/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/fr/handoffire
She planned on a long-term spellfire-based cage; what befell them with Shandril out? Are they related to Barrowfields item-bound ones? Why'd Mystra save them?
With the tumult of those times in the Realms at which HAND OF FIRE was set behind Toril now, the need to humble the mad Netherese Weave-wraiths has passed. Alustriel’s plan was for her to cage them with the Weave and her command of it, while Shandril’s spellfire  burned away some of their magical power and some of their madness with it.
As a Weavemaster, Alustriel can command the Weave with enough force and precision to call on it to cage wraiths or other powerful beings (living spells, for example) with a strong  magical nature. Her warning to Andras was for him to summon other Weavemasters (Elminster, her fellow Sisters, or other Chosen) in the event she herself went down, to re-encage the mad Netherese.
Mystra forbade their destruction because, despite their madness  pride, and fell intent, she wanted their magical knowledge and creativity (devising new spells) to be preserved. .because that’s the core of what Mystra seeks to do: make magic more widely used by everyone, and constantly make magic wider in its horizons (creative uses).

Does it make sense to allow the Zhents their own language, 'Zhentish'?
Local dialect (slang), certainly. However, so many Zhents have come from elsewhere, and speak Common along the trade routes and around the Moonsea, that they're mainly going to talk like Heartlands merchants everywhere.

No. What I've done down the years is think about who would have settled/predominated in a spot, what in-Realms language they speak, and what dipthongs and dominant vowel sounds and constructions are in this tongues. That in mind, I just make place names up.

It's still weird they didn't use Ed Greenwood's actual Undermountain. His maps were too squiggly, so they threw them out, substituted the artist's old home dungeon from an Empire of the Petal Throne campaign, and called it a day.
Wait, so does this mean no one has seen Greenwood's actual Undermountain or did I misunderstand?
TSR owns my uppermost level of Undermountain maps, and has seen (and received photocopies of) them, back in 1986, plus an upper level inside Mount Waterdeep. They also received and own the Blue Alley, the Dungeon of the Crypt, and several other "mini-dungeons"  inside Waterdeep.
If you examine the "Level 1" published maps of Undermountain, all of the central rectangle (the orange rooms and passages, and the yellow ones linking them) are my original layout, minus some inside-pillar shafts and stairs that connected  to the surface (cellars, inside building walls, and trapdoors in back alleys, in Waterdeep) and to dungeon levels below. Some of my original Level 2 layout (around the river and Skullport) made it into print, too.

Master, a newborn heir must rise fast—darkness looms! I've scourged Chronomancy, but couldn't find anything to hasten his growth. Does such magic exist? (If not, perhaps Elminster knows? 😊) Thank you for the Realms!
Chronomancy is chasing a dream made of wisps of light and mist: it's far more ideas and concepts than dependable magic. Reliably, all one could do is send the heir ahead in time, to arrive in a future year just as he is now (so, with no more experience or  physical maturation). There's no substitute or workaround for real-world lived experience. Spells can make someone larger and stronger, but don't teach mastery of the new might and frame. Only a life filled with variety of adventure does that. Sorry.
How about sending them to another plane or sphere? Are there any where time flows faster or slower than Toril?
Yes, BUT no one's ever charted the differences in time flows, and they seem to change, sometimes suddenly and greatly, like water disturbed by big solid things plunging into the flows.

AD&D Terrors Unleashed
The AD&D Dracolich doesn't just breathe death-it savors your fear. Undead dragon with a soul gem that laughs at your vorpal blade.
One icy blast, and your party's frozen; one bad save, and its fear aura breaks your will. 5E might give you a shot, but AD&D snarls, "Face its skull, and you're already ash."
Enter its hoard, and you're already doomed
Clyde told me he spent two straight days painting the treasure everyone's wading around in.
Elminster looks quite surprised for a well experienced adventurer.
He's surprised Shandril's being such a reckless idiot, unleashing at the dracolich without going for the head.

How would the Zhentarim react to an agent of theirs going rogue, splitting from the main bidy and using their cell to take over, lets say the ten-towns?
Badly. "Freelancing" is usually rewarded by death, within the Brotherhood--unless the results are such an advance that leadership is surprised and delighted. Even then, the "reward" is usually to be sent on missions far, far away.

It has happened already: Qilué of the Seven Sisters is shared by Mystra and Eilistraee. It is VERY rare, as deities tend to mistrust each other so deeply. Allied deities quietly assisting each other's Chosen (e.g. among the Triad) isn't rare.

Got a blue dragon crisis rn. When half-dragons are made with mammalian humanoids, is it a live-birth, shelled eggs, or does it depend on the mother?
If the mammalian humanoid is the mother, and the birth is successful, the half-dragon emerges as a nine-pound-or-so curled-up miniature half-dragon in a caul that typically ruptures as it comes out, amid a wash of fluid, the caul being very like a soft, thin rubbery egg around the baby.

Hi [@] Two questions from a fresh watch of the D&D movie:
What’re the mechanics behind a Red Wizard Blade blocking out clerical magic? Is it the whole weave?
Were any prominent Waterdhavian nobles caught up in the Beckoning Death?
Cheers as always!
SOME Red Wizard blades have enchantments powerful enough to deflect/bend the Weave in a small space around them; this can cause certain spells that aren't touch magics to "miss." There are spells to mitigate/lessen this.
No "important" nobles; the affected were idle wastrels, mainly third sons and sidelined "uncles" whose leisure time was devoted to drinking and gambling.
Heads of houses were leery of visiting and investing in Neverwinter well before Dagult Neverember "fell ill."

As of 1500 DR, in the Realms, it's now common usage to address someone as "gentle" (and a group as "gentles") regardless of station in society or gender. This is how most innkeepers and tavernmasters would greet strangers.
There's also an increasing use of "saer" in the same way (used regardless of gender or apparent gender, and station in society).
Followup, sorry! How would Saer be pronounced? Is it sigh-air or say-er or sahr?
SAIR" (Say-er without the hyphen, so all run together in one syllable)

Hi mr. Greenwood
I'm thinking about adding Calimar Arkhenneld as NPC and maybe future quest giver in the Elminster Tower in Shadowdale. I'm wondering what would be he doing there and can a lich even eat and drink wine etc. when he rests from the Underdark stuff?
Calimar would be in Elminster’s Tower on Mystra’s business: the goddess told him to work with Elminster on an endeavour, likely spreading “old” spellbooks and scrolls among the drow as “use more magic” seeds—so he’d be crafting such “fake old” items.
Liches can eat and drink normally, though they derive no sustenance thereby (and if the lich is sufficiently decayed, everything just “falls through,” so polite liches arrange a catch-bucket).

If you're already really rich, a knighthood AND land grant (waving the chance at a future baronial title), and if already noble, an office (such as Warden of the Ports, or Warden of Tunland).

This is OFFICIAL.
How so?
Well, this was the result of a long philosophical argument over beer: Gary Gygax, Len Lakofka, Jim Ward, and me.
Back and forth the points flew, amid much discussion , but in the end, Gary agreed with this interpretation. With a warning: DMs MUST police  with barriers to teleportation, or "the abuse will be MASSIVE." (His words.)
