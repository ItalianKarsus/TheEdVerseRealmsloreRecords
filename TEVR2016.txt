Wed Sep 14 15:28:40 (Mulmaster)

?_>' [@] Hey Ed. I was wondering if the Cloaks of Mulmaster have a symbol and what it looks like. Do they wear particular colors too? 
+_>' [@] They all have dark maroon weathercloaks (hoods, ankle-length, heavy fabric against winter cold) and ankle-length black cloaks 
+_>' [@] but usually wear these only when gathering to admit, dismiss, or discipline members. Under them, and the rest of the time 
+_>' [@] ..they dress as they please. They seldom use their symbol, which is a tall, slender tower (thin triangle) against a maroon sky  
+_>' [@] (representing the real Tower which is their formal meeting-place/seat of power). On rare occasions they send written messages  
+_>' [@] (usually to the Blades) written on paper (yes, Mulmaster has fine paper; mills in the Vast to the south of the city) with  
+_>' [@] vertical stripes down left side of page (black outside, maroon inside, ALMOST touching, stripes about the width of an adult  
+_>' [@] finger. A few older Cloak members have finger-rings or belt buckles with the tower symbol graven on them (in an oval), but in 
+_>' [@] general, this group isn't big on symbols or colors or pageantry. They like to influence through fear, and personally stay  
+_>' [@] anonymous. (Hope these lore tidbits help.)

Mon Sep 19 17:59:37 (Sword Coast, Toril, Waterdeep, the Realms)

?_>'#DnD [@] gotten curious of something;
Calimport has been stated to be the biggest city in Faerûn (if not Toril) [1/2] 
?_>'#DnD [@] Waterdeep has been called its Northern counterpart before;
So is Waterdeep the 2nd largest city in Faerûn? 
+_>' [@] Short answer: No. Waterdeep has a large TRANSIENT population (visiting traders, nobles who go south to more temporate climes 
+_>' [@] every winter). Our focus on Waterdeep, and its dominance of the hinterland it serves (the Sword Coast) makes it seem  
+_>' [@] larger than it is, because of its importance (it's neutral trading ground/meeting place for MANY). Census details in the  
+_>' [@] Realms are notoriously unreliable, because they're really tax rolls, and lots of folk like to duck paying taxes 
+_>' [@] Calimport gets a "diligently high" population figure because its taxes and registers all slaves, and household servants, so  
+_>' [@] they ALL get recorded. Other cities (in the South) may well have near-equal or larger populations, but don't have tax  
+_>' [@] rolls as large. I think Waterdeep is the most socially IMPORTANT city in the Realms because it's so tolerant/relatively  
+_>' [@] lightly governed, so attracts entrepreneurs, misfits, everyone to live together in get-rich-quick harmony

?_>' [@] Hey Ed, would you say the style of governing in the Shining Lands was Monarchy, Theocracy, or Oligarchy? 
?_>' [@] Also, did Var sink before, during, or after the Spellplague? And how did this affect the neighbouring nations and trade? 
+_>' [@] Before, but slowly, so massive migration to nearby lands and therefore trade adjusted accordingly.
