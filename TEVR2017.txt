?_>' [@] Hello Ed, I've been working on this Waterdeep environs' map, and it's been quite a work. Need some information to make it right [:] 
?_>' [@] 1- Is the distance between Waterdeep and the Dessarin ok?
Is the distance between Waterdeep and the Rathills ok? 
+_>' [@] Hi, Eduardo! Nice map. The Dessarin is WAY too close, and therefore, so is the Rat Hills (think of a three hour or longer slow dung-wagon  
+_>' [@] journey, once outside the southernmost city gate). Once beyond the meadows where citizens picnic and nobles fly their falcons, kept as  
+_>' [@] "common" land (in the main, for caravan camping and assembly use), which lie directly east of the city, farmland beyond is all owned by  
+_>' [@] someone. In the 1200s and earlier, it was mainly held by nobles, who rented it to tenant farmers (Deep families growing their own food  
+_>' [@] ,,,and selling the xcess), but over the years, nobles needing coin have sold off more and more, until by the 1400s, nobles only retain  
+_>' [@] their more distant estates (Amphail and beyond, mainly up that road), and wealthy commoners own the farmlands near the city. And almost 
+_>' [@] ..all of them rent those lands out for tillage or grazing (mainly tillage). These farms produce food crops, and sometimes fatten up  
+_>' [@] livestock by grazing: both things that can't be done inside the city walls in the scale needed to do more than feed one family.

Thu Aug 10 00:45:18 (Castle Ward, Tower of the Order)

?_>' [@] Greetings again from the UK, what can you reveal about Mhair Szeltune, her tower and its layout? Many thanks as always ~GG 
+_>' [@] See p30 of Eric L Boyd's CITY OF SPLENDORS: WATERDEEP 3e hardcover tome. Mhair dwelt in a modest mansion in Castle Ward, not a tower. As 
+_>' [@] ..head of the Watchful Order, she spent much of her time in the Tower of the Order; its layout is spell-warded and secret for security  
+_>' [@] reasons (though a little has been published). Her home, like the Tower, had many cellar connections to other structures nearby, so she  
+_>' [@] and other Order mages could enter and depart unseen (as they'd not have to use the visible doors). I can tell you that Mhair's home  
+_>' [@] was narrow, rose four floors above the street (plus an attic) and 3 levels below, and had a "fireman's pole" descent in a hidden shaft  
+_>' [@] for swift getaways from her bedchamber, the library beneath, the meeting room beneath that, and the dining room beneath that. Down  
+_>' [@] into a cellar level. Mhair had modest tastes, and preferred solid hues and uncluttered rooms, not gaudy decor or knick-knacks. 
+_>' [@] You will find mentions of Mhair's "tower," but that's due to a habit of the time: wizards of sufficient means had "decoy towers" foes and  
+_>' [@] thieves could attack, and never find the wizard (or their valuables) there, just endless traps. Works for tax collectors, too

Sun Dec 10 18:17:53 (Netherese, Netheril, the Realms)

?_>' [@] - I have a question about Sune's chronological presence within the Realms.
How long has she actually been around?
Some sources state that Selûne was the goddess  of beauty to the Netherese.
Was Sune not around at that point, or was she simply not acknowledged [ .] 
+_>' [@] Sune was around, but her worship was a fledgling "cult" in Netheril, popular among the "Low" Netherese (the workers), far less so among the mighty. Selûne was indeed the goddess of beauty. Sune began as a goddess of the sensual (not just sex; textures and looks of all things). 
+_>' [@] Probably not. To her clergy and all mortals alive today, Sune has "always been here," and even back at the time of Netheril, there was no sense she was "from elsewhere." Some mortals believe nigh all deities are ascended mortals (with the exceptions of Selûne, Shar, et cetera).

+_>' [@] 2of3:
She was depicted as having a long mane (ponytail) of rich reddish-black hair, so a lock of hair in that rare hue is often used as a “touchstone”/keepsake by those who revere her (or want her aid when they have to “think something through”). 
+_>' [@] 3of3:
However, her holy/temple symbol was a chevron-shaped (like Superman’s chest shield) group of three side-on black interlocked cogs (“gears”/toothed wheels, big top wheel interlocked with medium middle wheel that’s interlocked with a small bottom wheel (on a field of gold).

?_>' [@] [@] [@] What would most pirates use as weaponry? Do they use magic like canons? A well placed fireball should surely sink a ship? 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] 1/3) Bombards use the ground to take their recoil and great weight. Most Realms ships can't handle cannon recoils (wheeled shipboard  
+_>' [@] [@] [@] 2/3) . . . carriages not invented yet). Airships can get hurled backwards by cannonfire. So most warships use rams, side-shears (against oar 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] 3/4) s and enemy hull), ballistae (volleys of javelins or heavy crossbow bolts) or mangonels hurling "firepots." Fireballs burn NOT sink 
+_>' [@] [@] [@] 4/4) . . . right away. Many ships carry sandbags, water cistern to quench deck fires. MOST pirates: crossbow volley, then storm and board.

I've got about 15,000 gold on my character, and I don't want to take it to Chult with me. That seems like a bad idea. :) 
+_>' [@] [@] I agree. Most Waterdhavians in that situation would "go in" (a partial share) on a market stall or goods wagon rental, via a guild. If they didn't mind higher risk, they'd go in on a ship or caravan cargo. (Much more gold to "place"? The usual "placer" is property rental.)

Mon Sep 18 03:15:10 (Cormyr)

?_>' [@] can you describe what Arabel looks like from the street on a typical day? What do the buildings and people look like? 
+_>' [@] Cobbled streets (overlaid by tiny mud and dung patches here and there), all wide enough for 2 large wagons to comfortably pass and still  
+_>' [@] leave room for foot traffic. Buildings three or four floors high (with cellars, too), and steeply-pitched shingle or shake or slate  
+_>' [@] roofs (almost no tiled roofs due to winds and severe winter cold), those roofs being steeply-pitched ("highpoint") to shed snow; many  
+_>' [@] chimneys and dormers. Half-timbered ("Tudor") upper floors that jut out over streets, lower floors of fitted fieldstone and/or brick 
+_>' [@] Most buildings battered/weathered, but good and solid (rebuilt often due to chimney fires, high storm winds, winter "claw"). Many warehouses 
+_>' [@] and wagons; clearly a caravan/trading city, wherever your eye falls. Many horse troughs and pumps (freeze during winter, when cellar  
+_>' [@] pumps that don't are used exclusively), but kept filled in other months in case of raids out of the Stonelands, so city never runs short 
+_>' [@] of untainted water (Crown law about this). Other laws: streets may not be blocked except by Purple Dragons and Town Watch (i.e. be  
+_>' [@] careful when parking wagons). People: wide ethnic mix of humans (drow, "goblinkin," and half-orcs not welcome), dwarves. A passing  
+_>' [@] scattering of gnomes, halflings, and elves. Much transient (caravan and peddler/wayfaring merchant) traffic. Covert Crown spies keep  
+_>' [@] ..watch for Cormyr over who arrives and leaves (to guard against rebellion, not just invasion, though this is more historical holdover  
+_>' [@] than sharp concern, these days). Rainwater shed from roofs goes down wide pipes into barrels and cellar-cisterns. Youth with slings  
+_>' [@] keep pigeons and the like rare sights within the city walls. Camping paddocks for caravans outside city walls, policed by Purple Dragons 
+_>' [@] (who provide firewood, and forbid the cutting of brush for some distance around Arabel, except for the brush clearing they themselves do 
+_>' [@] to make sure any potential besiegers lack cover).
Think that covers the basics. Just ask if you'd like more.

?_>' [@] How is Volo still alive? He's human, supposedly, but his writing career has spanned over 100 years (1356 DR - 1480s DR)?

+_>' [@] other Chosen are under instructions to see to his survival when they can.) Volo doesn't know about this. He believes he was thrust

?_>' [@] In regards famous spellbooks like those found in the OGB and "Pages from the Mages

+_>' [@] (i) Many sages value rare spellbooks as beyond price. What they’ll fetch in coin varies wildly, depending on the seller (how desperate?) and buyer (is magic any use to me personally? do I know someone I think I can sell it to? is dealing with them worth the danger I perceive?). 
+_>' [@] (i, concluded):
So, in short, it really “depends.” Rough rule of thumb: several tens of thousands of gold pieces per complete-seeming spell a buyer wants. 
+_>' [@] (ii) Usually, yes, though in some cases this will cause the spell being copied to fade away from the original, or it will trigger “hung and waiting” spells to act on the copier. (Depends on the enchanted nature of the spellbook.) 
+_>' [@] (iii) Usually, yes, a spell in a spellbook can be studied (taking the usual time and requiring the usual light sufficient for reading), and memorized, in the usual manner. Again, complications may arise depending on the magics of the spellbook. 
+_>' [@] (iv)
Again, the best answer is “it depends.” On the location (city? trackless wilderlands? Underdark? affects availability of tutors), available funds, and personal nature (are they a drow or a creature thought of as a “monster”?) of the individual wanting to learn. 
+_>' [@] (iv, continued:)
Also depends on what’s going on (wartime? deep harsh winter?), what the learner is willing to do (become an apprentice? undertake dangerous “fetch this” quests for a tutor?), and many other factors. Schools of wizardry are NOT plentiful, and neither are non- 
+_>' [@] (iv, concluded:) evil spellcasters willing to tutor, except to further a fervent cause (so learner may have to join and serve a faction, etc.). Evil spellcasters all too apt to use learners as fodder for experiments/dangerous adventuring missions.

+_>' [@] [@] Many! Temples and guilds (for their members only, or those trying to pay their members) act as banks. So does the city (Piergeiron's Palace). And for those who want "off the books" transactions, there are many, many private moneylenders (such as the infamous Mirt).

?_>' [@] Hi Mr Greenwood! I'm prepping to play a war domain cleric of Torm in Tyranny of Dragons. I love Cormyr &amp; wondered what specific role (if any) clerics trained as warrior-priests could fulfill in the Purple Dragons. Thanks for answering our questions, hi from Holland 
+_>' [@] Hi, Gerben! Warrior-priest clerics would be scattered through the ranks to be "battlefield medics" for every harmar (=strike force=platoon, in modern parlance). Ideally, two attached to every recce band sent out.

?_>' [@] The Order of the Gauntlet in 5e mentions followers of Tyr, Torm and Helm as members but not of Ilmater. Has he left the Triad, or does he shun martial endeavors? Thanks!

+_>' [@] [@] 
Already popular with the folk of Shadowdale, Khara Sulwood was proclaimed Lady of Shadowdale at dusk that same day, and still rules there now.
